---

## Overview

The BMAD framework represents a structured approach to AI-assisted development that transforms casual "vibe coders" into professional developers. It combines spec-driven development, context engineering, and agile methodologies.

## What is BMAD?

BMAD stands for an agile, full-stack development method emphasizing documentation before coding. Rather than jumping directly into implementation, the workflow requires comprehensive planning through multiple specialized agents.

## The Problem It Solves

Vibe coding—rapid app building without structured planning—typically produces "spaghetti code" and fails at production scale. BMAD addresses this by establishing systematic processes.

## The BMAD Workflow Structure

The methodology operates in two primary phases:

### Planning Phase

| Agent | Deliverable |
|-------|-------------|
| **Product Manager** | Product Requirements Document (PRD) |
| **UX Designer** | Interface specifications |
| **Architect** | Full-stack architecture document |
| **Product Owner** | Alignment verification across all documents |

### Development Phase

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Document Sharding** | Documents broken into manageable sections |
| **Story Creation** | Scrum Master breaks work into individual user stories |
| **Implementation** | Developer agent executes each story with clear acceptance criteria |
| **Iteration** | Sprints continue until project completion |

## Key Tools & Setup

### Installation
```bash
npx bmad method install
```

Run in your project directory.

### IDE Integration
The framework integrates with:
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Other AI-enabled IDEs

### Cost Management
Planning leverages web UIs (Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude) to manage token costs efficiently.

## Practical Results

The methodology enables developers to:
- Establish proper testing infrastructure (Jest, Playwright)
- Maintain consistent project structure
- Achieve significantly higher success rates when building production-level applications with AI assistance

## Key Benefits

1. **Structure over chaos** - Replaces ad-hoc prompting with formal workflows
2. **Documentation-driven** - All artifacts become reference materials
3. **Scalable** - Works for solo developers and teams
4. **Production-ready** - Focus on shipping real applications, not prototypes
