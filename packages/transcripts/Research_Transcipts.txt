Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to week one of quantum growth. And in
0:18
this week, what we're really going to be doing is we're going to be laying the
0:22
foundation. And I'm going to be showing you like what I'm seeing in the
0:26
marketplace and this kind of shifting of the tectonic plates and really what is
0:31
becoming the most valuable currency in the world and that is attention because
0:37
you know really that's where it all starts in building a business. If you
0:40
think about what is the very very first step and it's really your ability to go
0:44
out there into your marketplace and to capture the attention of who your dream
0:49
prospects are because if you can't get their attention, you can't try to
0:54
generate a lead, you can't generate a sale, you can't build a team, you can't
0:58
get an office, you can't do anything. So that's really the first stepping stone
1:02
in the equation is being apt to go out into a marketplace and grab that
1:06
market's attention. And it's becoming increasingly more difficult in order to
1:10
do that. You know, social media and this total age, like this digital age that
1:15
we're living in, there has never ever been a more fragmented and chaotic
1:20
blizzard of noise that our prospects are being bombarded with notifications on
1:25
their phone. They've got multiple tabs open on their computers. There's apps
1:30
pushing notification. And there's Instagram Live and Facebook Live and Tik
1:33
Tok and all types of crazy [ __ ] is going on, right? And I really believe that
1:38
it's never ever been a time in history where it's been easier to reach our
1:42
dream prospects, but that it's never been harder to get, keep, and then
1:46
leverage their attention and to focus their attention onto your offers and
1:51
onto your business. And this is something that I've been obsessed about
1:55
is really being, you know, a student of markets and a student of people and
1:59
seeing how people are engaging with technology, where are they going and
2:03
where are they spending their free time on and then having to move into these
2:07
platforms and moving into these markets and to be able to go in there and
2:11
extract some of that attention onto my business to go out there and get more
2:16
customers and to grow it. And I'm going to be really showing you what are the
2:20
trends, what we're seeing, what's happening, where the money is going,
2:22
where the attention is going, and the things to really look out for, and not
2:26
only to look out for them, but how to be brutally effective in going out and
2:30
getting attention. And if you're able to go out and be more effective at getting
2:34
those eyeballs, then you're going to get more of the market share in your
2:38
marketplace, and you're going to be growing your business at a much faster
2:42
rate than any of your competitors. Then I'm going to show you how to really
2:47
assess your market and get like a 10,000 foot level on it and just zoom out and
2:52
see, you know, who are the biggest competitors. You know, what is it that
2:56
the market is starving for? What is it? What are the products and services that
3:00
are selling the best? And then how to craft what I call crack bait. And that
3:05
is, you know, how to go out there and put a bait in your marketplace that
3:09
attracts only your dream prospects and absolutely drives them wild. And then
3:15
after you've gotten them to kind of raise their hand in just a sea full of
3:19
prospects, then how to motivate them to actually reach out to your team or reach
3:24
out to you and ask you for help in solving their most pressing problems
3:30
using a strategy called the Godfather Offer. And I'm going to show you how to
3:34
craft this up. And this thing just cripples even much more established
3:38
competitors. And people will just find it super super hard to compete with you
3:43
regardless of how big their marketing budget is or how big their team is or
3:47
how much resources that they've got to kind of deploy. And I'm going to show
3:51
you all of that and I'm going to be breaking it down and showing you all the
3:55
different constituent parts and then how to build it together to really lay the
4:00
foundation of this selling system that we're going to be deploying in your own
4:04
business to go out there and not only crush your competitors, but just grow
4:08
your business at a rapid rate and something that you just didn't even
4:11
think that was possible. I'm going to be showing you all the elements that you
4:15
need in order to make that possible and then how to apply it to your business
4:19
with the proven frameworks and the processes and the cheat sheets so you
4:23
can get it swiped and deployed in your business and you can start seeing
4:27
results straight away. So without further ado, what I want you to do is
4:30
get stuck into module one now and just dive head first into this program and
4:35
let me just reveal exactly what's happening in your marketplace, what's
4:39
happening as a macro trend in the world and how you can use these trends and
4:44
these shifting of the tectonic plates to go into your marketplace and completely
4:49
beat the pants of your competition. So go ahead and watch this video one now
4:53
and I will see you in the program.

Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to week one, module one of quantum
0:16
growth. And let me just say that I am so thrilled and excited to have you here
0:21
with me and really just to be helping you explode your business just to beyond
0:27
recognizable heights. And as you can tell from the name of this program,
0:32
Quantum Growth, this training isn't here to just help you grow in, you know, a
0:37
linear fashion or just marginally. No, no, no. I am here to really help you
0:42
make a quantum leap in growth for your business. And this is something that I
0:48
have certainly experienced in my own business, you know, in helping me go
0:52
from just being a one-man army in my bedroom, you know, making cold calls to
0:59
now, you know, employing 70 plus people and having an 8 figureure business by
1:04
using the same strategies that I'm going to be outlining to you over the course
1:09
of this program. But what's really more exciting is that once I deployed it in
1:14
my own business um just to explode it. I have gone out and deployed this in over
1:20
416 different industries and niches, you know, for hundreds and hundreds of
1:25
clients. And it's responsible for generating over $1.33 billion in sales.
1:31
And these is just every type of business that you could imagine that's selling a
1:36
service for a fee. And just to, you know, no matter what part of the world
1:41
that you're in, at what price point are you selling, this system just simply
1:46
works. And I have really just spent, you know, so much time obsessing over all of
1:53
the mechanics and kind of reverse engineering why it works so well and why
1:57
it is so brutally effective and looking at those guiding principles and then
2:02
have really just synthesized that down into this program and giving you all of
2:07
the tools that you can go out there and just apply this for your business in
2:12
your industry and your niche that you operate in. and just experience just
2:18
just absolute rapid growth, right? Um, and the things that I've seen this thing
2:24
do for businesses is just incredibly profound in such a short amount of time.
2:30
So, without further ado, let's get stuck into it. Now, what we're really seeing
2:37
right now is that the tectonic plates of business are shifting, right? Technology
2:43
is eating the world. It doesn't matter what sector of business that you're in,
2:49
what country of the world that you're in. Technology is just eating up the
2:54
world. And it is just, you know, really eating traditional business models and
2:59
crunching them out and just spitting them out. And there is no area of
3:03
business that is not being disrupted by technology. And really what you're
3:08
seeing is that, you know, even for businesses that sell things
3:11
predominantly offline, right? You might be, you know, you you're operating your
3:15
service business and you think, well, I deliver my my goods and services offline
3:19
typically, right? And so I'm kind of sheltered from this. No, you are not,
3:23
right? And because the way that people are buying has fundamentally changed and
3:27
it is changing and you know people's expectations of how to research you know
3:32
products and services is changing and then the way that those products and
3:36
services are delivered to the end user are also radically changing. And you
3:42
know we're living in a day and age where if you don't adapt you're just going to
3:46
be absolutely eaten alive and your business is not going to exist. And
3:50
we're already seeing that in just huge multi-billion dollar businesses that you
3:55
think kind of have moes around them and are sheltered from the disruption that's
4:00
taking place. And you know what I'm going to be showing to you is that that
4:03
that's actually not the case. And that like there is a changing of the guard,
4:07
right? There is shifting of those tectonic plates in which your business
4:11
is built on. And there's really, you know, now is the time to adopt or change
4:16
or you will simply be eradicated. Right? Before we get stuck into the I guess all
4:22
of the different weeds and and get carried away, let me just go over what
4:26
we'll be covering in in today's video. So, we're going to be really going
4:29
through the online convergence of business and what's happening with all
4:33
these people migrating online. We're going to be covering the shifting of the
4:37
business tectonic plates, the rising of the red tide of competition and really
4:43
the new age of quantum growth. Now, why is this important? Right? And
4:49
why is it important now? Right? And as I mentioned that the world is changing and
4:54
consumers are changing and therefore business is changing and unless you
4:59
evolve with this new digital economy, your business will be wiped out and you
5:05
will be eradicated off the face of the earth. And that's definitely what we are
5:10
seeing across all sectors, across all industries and niches, regardless of
5:15
what it is that you sell, to whom you sell it, and at what price point you
5:20
sell it, right? And what we are seeing is that there's this huge convergence
5:27
online, right? And everybody is flooding online. And even if you sell a product
5:33
that is not bought online, that does not matter. We're talking about the online
5:38
convergence for attention, right? Where is it heading? What is going on? And
5:43
this is what's happening, right? So the average daily of minutes of consumption
5:47
per person, you know, looking at this is essentially what television consumption
5:53
looks like in the states, right? Um and that's that yellow line that you can see
5:57
tracking down here. And then look at mobile and look at desktop desktop,
6:01
right? we we have a fundamental shift in where the attention is and where it's
6:06
going and what we can do with that, right? Because if everybody's flooding
6:11
online and if everybody's like, you know, mobile phones and desktop
6:14
computers is out surpassing television is the number one place where people
6:18
spend their time that is changing how people interact with businesses and what
6:25
they're doing and where you're going to target these people. Right now, let's
6:29
look at Netflix. So Netflix surpasses major cable providers in the US. Um and
6:35
this red line is what you can see is the number of Netflix subscribers with the
6:40
blue line versus the cable pay TV subscribers in the US, right? Um and in
6:46
2017 we we saw Netflix outs surpass traditional cable providers, right? Um
6:53
that is just huge, right? So more people, more attention, more eyeballs
6:59
are on Netflix than they are cable television right now. And this is what
7:04
that growth looks like. Okay, so you know the stats that we're looking at is
7:08
obviously United States and you might be like, "Cool, that's a United States
7:11
subary." Well, you know, look at what's happening in the international paid
7:15
sector, right? It is just exploding, right? And Netflix hits 149 million paid
7:22
subscribers of which 88 million are outside the US. Right? More people
7:29
spending more money on Netflix looking at this online platform than they are
7:37
traditional. Now, how does this translate into the
7:40
business world? Well, Netflix becomes the world's most valuable entertainment
7:45
company, right? They overtook Walt Disney and they also overtook Comcast.
7:51
Right? That's just a huge huge mon monumental day where you've got the
7:57
biggest entertainment companies in the world being disrupted over the course of
8:02
less than a decade by these digital platforms coming in and now
8:07
outsurpassing them in terms of the most valuable company out there.
8:12
So typically, you know, the way that the old offline model works is that, you
8:18
know, you'd be running ads offline or you'd be in the yellow pages or you'd be
8:22
doing traditional types of advertising, even television and radio. And what's
8:27
really happening right now is that we are converging to the new online world
8:33
where everything is digital, right? every single marketing activity that you
8:39
actually do is still digital marketing. And the reason that I say that is
8:44
because if you're advertising offline, if you're using radio, if you're using
8:49
television, or if you're using traditional print advertising,
8:53
what do you think people do when they see those ads? They jump onto Google and
8:58
they search for you. And all you're really doing is funneling eyeballs from
9:03
that offline world and you're bringing them to the new online world, right? And
9:08
that's really what we're seeing. And if we have a look in 2018
9:14
at the global advertising expenditure, the internet as a channel is now the
9:20
single largest advertising channel on planet earth, outsurpassing all of the
9:26
other channels, right? And that is really like, you know, I've been in in
9:30
into digital marketing for enough time that when I first began, we were like
9:36
the red-headed stepchild in the room that no one really paid a huge amount of
9:40
attention to. And what's happening right now is like, you know, we always got the
9:45
very small percentage of ad spend. And it was kind of like, oh, that that's
9:49
that cute digital thing. Well, right now there is only digital. That is the
9:53
number one big 800B gorilla in the room. and everything in terms of how people
10:00
are spending their money in order to acquire new customers has been pivoted
10:05
over to online. And you know, a lot of people, you know, when they think about
10:10
this and they think about traditionally how business is done and this huge rise
10:15
of of internet marketing, they do get a bit carried away, right? And the reason
10:20
that I say that they get carried away is because if you look at total retail
10:24
spending, right? And let's just have a look at like the
10:28
e-commerce share of retail spending in the following countries, right? Look at
10:33
the USA here, right? You can see that around 10% of the total spending is done
10:39
online, right? In China, you know, it's almost touching 25%.
10:45
The UK also in the high teens and so you got South Korea there, um,
10:51
which is also, you know, above 20%. And then the UK as I said high teens, USA at
10:56
10%, Western Europe under 10%, Japan, India, Eastern Europe, Russia and
11:01
Brazil. Right? So really like if you have a look at like okay well digital
11:07
and internet is the number one advertising channel yet only 10% of
11:12
retail in the states is actually done online, right? And you might be
11:16
thinking, well, you know, I I I sell a service sub, so we don't even do
11:20
e-commerce, right? And I'll get to that in just a moment. But what you can see
11:24
right here is that most of the people are online, but most of the money is not
11:31
just yet, right? Because people are researching these things. They're
11:35
researching online and they're looking for products and services online. But in
11:40
your case, typically they're going to be making an inquiry online and then that's
11:44
going to result in someone getting on the telephone or booking in a
11:47
face-to-face meeting or whatever it might be to actually convert them as a
11:51
customer. So that's typically what we can see by the stats is just looking at
11:55
the overall amount of commerce that's actually done online. And what I mean by
12:00
this is if if you take into consideration the stats that we just
12:04
looked at, you can see that most countries, you know, around the world
12:08
only have about less than 10% of total retail spending is happening online. Now
12:14
that is changing at a rapid rapid rate, right? And those percentages are going
12:19
up year on year. But what is happening is people are doing all their research
12:22
when buying a product service online. And that's the main thing that we're
12:27
going to be concerned with because you might be making all of your sales over
12:31
the phone or face to face. And but the way that people are researching and
12:35
finding solutions to their problems is online. Like it just you can just see
12:40
that with the attention and where it's all flowing. Um and if you look at like
12:44
the meteoric rise of like Netflix. Okay. Now let's kind of take another look at
12:50
this online convergence and what's really happening here. And this is
12:55
another example of like digital technology and how it's changing and how
13:00
it's rad radically disrupting traditional business. Now, not only is
13:05
Amazon the largest online retailer in the world, it also wants to disrupt
13:11
physical retail, right? And they they've opened up these shops where there's no
13:16
lines, there's no checkout. You just basically walk in and pick up what you
13:20
want and walk out. Seriously. Right. So, you log in through these gates here and
13:26
there's a QR code that you can scan before you walk into the store. And the
13:31
the crazy thing is, right, is you just look at the ceiling in this image,
13:34
right? And you'll see all those little black squares and they're all cameras
13:39
and there's hundreds and hundreds of cameras on every single aisles, right?
13:44
And there's like sensors and basically Amazon knows not only what
13:50
you did buy like when you walked in the store, picked it up, and then checked
13:53
out, but they also know what you didn't buy. Why? Right? And what what you were
13:57
really close to buying and then it can retarget you online. So if you go pick
14:02
up some yogurt, those sensors and those cameras are watching you. You put it
14:05
down and then you start getting retargeted online. They're linking that
14:10
activity, you know, with that QR code to your Amazon account. And then they can
14:14
follow you around and and retarget you, right? You might be like, "Holy [ __ ]
14:18
that's scary, Sabry. This is what's happening. This is what you have to look
14:22
forward to. This is where we are heading, you know, as like a community,
14:27
as as an whole country, as a whole, you know, civilization of people in this
14:33
convergence of online that it's not just like, oh, okay, well, like grocery
14:37
stores are never going to be disrupted." Wrong. Everything as you know it is
14:40
going to be disrupted, right? So, Amazon knows that you what you didn't buy. They
14:46
know what you're close to buy and they're going to follow you around and
14:48
then they can retarget. And that's just one element. You might be like, "Cool,
14:51
that's grocery store sub." Like, I'm not selling yogurts or energy drinks. Like,
14:56
I'm a consultant. I'm a coach. I'm a service business provider. How is this
15:00
applicable to me? Like, I don't really understand, you know, h how this applies
15:04
to my business. Well, let me just show you exactly what's happening. Right? So
15:09
what you can see here is you know facial recognition using AI technology. Um and
15:15
this is something that China you know is really at the forefront of and that they
15:19
have rolled out. But rather than me just like explaining it to you. Let me just
15:23
show this small clip for you from the Washington Post. China's pursuing an
15:27
ambitious plan to create an omnipresent video surveillance network. The Schweang
15:32
or Sharp Eyes project aims to extend and integrate video surveillance from cities
15:38
into villages and from roads into residential compounds. It aims to use
15:43
artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning to analyze this mountain
15:48
of video evidence to work out who's doing what, where, and when, to track
15:54
suspects and the people they associate with, and even to predict crime. In
16:00
November, I visited three tech companies in the cities of Beijing and Chongqing
16:04
to see how China plans to make the communist slogan, the masses have sharp
16:09
eyes, into a reality. Here are a few of the ideas that the tech companies
16:14
showcase. These cameras are looking at a road
16:20
junction and they're identifying everything that's passing through.
16:23
They're looking at cars, reading the number plates, and they're looking at
16:27
pedestrians, classifying pedestrians according to their age, their gender,
16:32
what kind of clothes they're wearing, even what kind of hairstyles they have.
16:35
This software analyzes crowds. It's producing a heat map of where people are
16:40
massing together. The sort of thing you might use to prevent overcrowding. You
16:45
can also see that it's also able to track individuals through the crowd. So,
16:50
if you're looking for a suspect, this is the kind of software you might want to
16:53
use. Here, we can see two cameras picking faces out of the crowd,
16:58
comparing those faces to a national database of suspects of wanted men and
17:03
women. The police then look at the matches that are flagged and see whether
17:07
they think that's someone they're looking for. They can then swoop in to
17:12
potentially arrest or question the person that the cameras have identified.
17:16
A completely different application. Now, this camera is trained on the face of a
17:21
truck driver. It's looking at his facial expressions and what he's doing to see
17:25
whether he's showing any signs of tiredness. If the score rises above a
17:29
certain level, then he's seen as too tired to drive. His company will be
17:34
alerted. They'll give him a call and tell him to take a rest. The Sharp Eyes
17:39
project has already been rolled out in more than 50 cities. So far, the tech
17:43
doesn't quite match the ambition, but experts agree that facial recognition is
17:48
improving fast and is a technology of the future. Concerns are being raised
17:53
about whether the system will be used in China to unfairly target ethnic
17:58
minorities or be used as a way to crack down on dissident and activists. But in
18:03
the tech startups that I visited, the young elite staff seemed cheerfully
18:08
unaware of those kind of concerns. It's not coming, right? It is already
18:18
here. And that just highlights, you know, just some of the changes that that
18:22
really are are coming in the years ahead and that have already been rolled out,
18:26
right? And have already been integrated without your knowledge. And you might be
18:30
thinking like, okay, cool. Like that that's pretty tech. That's pretty crazy.
18:34
How does it relate to me getting more customers? Great question. So basically
18:39
what you can see here is like this is you know an ad that that I have run and
18:45
this is using technology that is facial recognition and this is something that
18:50
already Google and Facebook have rolled out that are already using on their ad
18:54
platforms to determine what is going on. Now what you can see here is that it's
19:00
scanning my face and it's putting emotion to it very likely in terms of
19:04
happiness and joy. Um, and then it's bringing up phase two. Um, which is my
19:08
good old friend Salt Bay here, Nuzit. And he's very unlikely that he has those
19:12
emotions, right? And it has a 93% confidence. It's picked up two men. Then
19:17
it's got Yep. So here, two men. And this is a confidence level that it's brought
19:21
up. Now look what it's picking up. Hair, selfie, cool, arm, photography, muscles,
19:26
smile, glasses, vacation, um, web entities, text. It's reading for any
19:31
text on there. brings up the colors, any properties around this, the ratios, and
19:35
then it can tell us it's like, you know, there's adult content or it's spoofy or
19:39
there's anything. And then look at the code, right? So, this is the type of
19:44
code that it's bringing in. And what it's actually looking at is the
19:48
different like measurements between the right eye to the left eye and the
19:52
eyebrow. And this is how it's basically determining whether or not that person
19:57
is smiling or there is joy or any of those kind of stuff, right? Um, and this
20:02
is something that Facebook basically use and it's called Deep Face and it is a
20:07
deep learning facial recognition system created by Facebook and it identifies
20:12
faces using advanced deep learning neural network. So a neural network is a
20:19
piece of software that basically simulates a very basic approximation of
20:24
how real neurons in the brain work. And deep learning is one of the methods of
20:30
performing machine learning. Basically, what it does is it looks at a huge body
20:35
of data. For example, human faces. And it tries to develop a highlevel
20:40
abstraction of that human face by looking at reoccurring patterns like
20:45
their cheeks and the eyebrows and the measurements between them. And in this
20:50
case, deep face consists of a bunch of like neuron neurons that are like nine
20:55
layers deep. And then it basically uses learning process to then see and create
21:01
120 million connections or synapses between those neurons based on a corpus
21:08
of 4 million photos of a face. Right? So basically what that means is that you
21:13
know you're uploading a picture of yourself to Facebook then you know
21:18
typically there's multiple you know photos that you're uploading. They're
21:21
getting all the different angles and the measurements and then they're really
21:25
just forming this AI technology to be able to map out exactly what's going on
21:32
right now. Again, you might be like, "Cool, Facebook has rolled that out.
21:37
How's that going to help me subre? How is that going to help me get more
21:40
customers?" Well, I'm going to tell you. So, you
21:44
know, in in in my agency, you know, we we spend tens of millions of dollars
21:50
every single year on advertising, right? A lot of paid advertising, a lot of
21:55
Facebook ads, a lot of Google ads across all different channels. And you know,
22:01
when you're spending tens of millions of dollars and when you have spent more
22:05
than a hundred million dollars on advertising, you really start to look at
22:09
what works and what doesn't work. And we're always looking for the edge in my
22:13
agency, right? Like how can we get our clients better results? What are some
22:17
other things that we could be doing to really game the system and get a better
22:22
output, right? And in order to do that, you need to understand the machine. You
22:26
need to understand like the the delivery vehicles that you're putting ads on and
22:30
what is it that they want and what is the AI and what is the technology and
22:34
algorithms that they're using to determine what is a good ad, what is a
22:39
bad ad, what do their users want, right? So, as I showed you before, right, with
22:44
a scan of my face, this is another like this is another screenshot using that
22:48
same platform and I'll I'll include links, you know, later in this program
22:53
to use this software so you can go on and have a play around yourself. But, as
22:57
you can see on this image, right, look at the emotions that it's saying. So,
23:00
it's saying like joy is very unlikely, sorrow, like it's kind of like there's
23:05
there's not really any strong polarization with the emotion of this
23:10
image. And this is an image that we used on one of the ads to to promote our
23:14
agency, right? And now we'll this ad didn't do very very well, right? And you
23:22
know, we obviously split test headlines and body copy and all the different kind
23:26
of variables in that equation to find out why not. But now we've got another
23:32
image, right? And then this is just an image of me on my desk at my first
23:36
office. And you'll see on this one, the emotion that they're saying is it's joy,
23:42
right? It's possible. And they've got a 71% confidence. And what we noticed is
23:48
that this ad in that same test with the same headline, same body copy, it did
23:53
better. We had a better cost per lead on this ad. Okay, cool. So, like there's,
23:58
you know, we see some correlation between the emotion of joy and a low
24:02
cost per lead. And we're obviously, you know, constantly split testing ads,
24:07
rolling out new ads. Then we rolled out this ad, right? And you can see that the
24:13
the the image on this one, joy is very likely. So it's not likely, it's very
24:18
likely. And look at the confidence level, 100%.
24:22
Right? So you know, this ad outperformed those other two images. And the
24:27
correlation with this one was the emotion was very likely to be joy. And
24:33
if you have a look at, you know, what these platforms, specifically Facebook
24:37
in this example, what their end outcome is, they want the engagement of their
24:43
users to be meaningful and to be happy, right? So therefore, if we're using
24:48
images in our ads that help them reach their objective, they reward us with
24:54
lower cost per leads, right? With higher return on investment. And that's why
24:59
this stuff matters, right? This is not just some cool stuff that they're
25:02
rolling out, you know, for Amazon or they're rolling out in China. This is
25:06
already rolled out. And if you're looking to get the edge, and obviously
25:10
you are because you've invested in this program and you're here to really
25:13
geometrically grow your business, then this is the stuff that we're going to be
25:17
diving deep into throughout this program is like really looking at it and
25:21
breaking it down beyond levels that you ever thought about or that anybody else
25:25
thinks about. And this is how we're able to really just go out there and just
25:29
annihilate the competition by looking at this scientifically and looking at this
25:35
and breaking it down to its constituent parts and finding out like what are the
25:41
things that really move the needle? How do we get an edge? Right? And this
25:46
really comes down to that it's clear to see when you look around that there is a
25:53
shifting of the tectonic plates and that technology is eating the world. And what
25:59
we're seeing is that we are now living in this new digital economy. And if you
26:05
don't believe me or if you think that I'm being sensationalist or I'm taking a
26:10
few isolated incidents and I'm blowing them up to be dramatic, that is very far
26:15
from the case. Let me show you, you know, what is happening on a macro
26:21
level. If we zoom out and we look across all industries, what is happening? And
26:26
what you can see here in this clip is that this is a list of the most valuable
26:30
companies in the world. And just watch this change, right? Look at the top.
26:34
We've got ProChina, Exxon Mobile and Walmart and BHP Bilitin. Look at these
26:41
companies, right? Look at what's happening as this video rolls, right?
26:46
And what you're going to be able to see is that there was like a a lot of
26:50
companies like Exxon Mobile, ProChina that are companies that are really their
26:56
whole market cap is really based on minerals and looking at, you know, raw
27:03
materials and petroleum and oil and all of those things. And now look what's
27:08
happening. Apple, right? Look at Microsoft.
27:12
Yeah, you still got ProChina and then you got Birkshshire Hathaway, Microsoft,
27:17
General Electric, Johnson and Johnson. Obviously, we're seeing a large
27:21
domination by the US, um, Chevron. Just have a look, right? And what you
27:27
can see here clearly is that the the top four or five companies and really the
27:32
top 10 companies are starting to consolidate in terms of
27:39
technology. Look at it. It's slowly eating up.
27:44
Eating up the most valuable companies in the world. Apple, Google, Microsoft.
27:49
Look at Facebook on the rise. Amazon continue to watch.
27:57
And it's just when you see it visually broken down like this, you know, over
28:03
time. This is like June 2017. Then we've got Tencent, Alibaba,
28:08
China enters the fold. Yeah. with with their e-commerce plays. Um, and then
28:14
look at this. Look what you're seeing. You're seeing that like, you know, nine
28:20
out of the 10 are technology companies and this has only happened in the last
28:28
10 years, right? Look at that. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google,
28:35
Birkshshire, Haway, Facebook, Alibaba, Tenzen, Johnson and Johnson, and Exxon
28:39
Mobile. Right? That's where we ended up um from April 2019. Um there's no other
28:45
kind of later stats than that right now, but that's what you can see like look at
28:51
that right in front of your eyes, right? And you know, you can see that 1 2 3 4 5
28:59
six out of those top 10, you know, are all technology companies, right? You've
29:05
only got Birkshshire, Haway, Johnson, um Exxon Mobile really. though out of those
29:10
nine, so three of them. Um, and look at the market capitalization
29:16
of the the Microsofts and the Apples and the Amazon. And this is only gotten more
29:21
crazy since then. It's only going to continue to get more crazy. Therefore,
29:27
we must evolve or die. It really is that simple. If you already know that there's
29:34
this huge convergence online and that technology is really going to be eating
29:39
up your industry and your category, no matter what the niche is that you
29:44
operate in, you know, you need to start looking at your service delivery. You
29:49
need to look at how people are researching your industry or the
29:54
problems that they're experiencing around the service that you actually
29:58
deliver and look at what is going to change like what is going to be
30:02
completely disrupted over the next coming years and over the next decade
30:07
because it is not the strongest of species that survive nor the most
30:13
intelligent right that survives. it is the one that is the most adaptable to
30:18
change and that's Charles Darwin who said that right and it's really you need
30:24
to have that it's not about how effective that you are now or your
30:28
position that you're in now it's you need to be open and adaptive and really
30:35
move and move with the trends of your market and the shifting of the tectonic
30:40
plates in order to be in a position of dominance and if you want to continue to
30:44
surv survive as an entity, as a species that is your business, then you're going
30:49
to need to adopt to these things and you're going to need to start really
30:52
getting scientific. You're going to need to start diving into all of the elements
30:56
that I'm going to be running you through throughout this program and mastering
31:00
these elements because what we are seeing is that now you might be in a
31:06
position where you're like, "Cool. I'm already out there. I've got a funnel.
31:09
I'm running webinars. I'm already doing lots of digital marketing. I'm running
31:12
Facebook ads, Google ads. has got retargeting, YouTube ads, the whole
31:16
works, right? And and that's really great if you already are doing that,
31:20
right? And even if you are doing that, what you are going to see now is the
31:26
rising of the Red Sea of competition, right? And you are going to need to be a
31:32
master master level marketer in order to be able to survive this because as I
31:39
highlighted earlier, right, the internet now is the number one advertising
31:44
platform on channel earth on planet Earth, sorry. um in terms of where the
31:49
ad dollars are going. And as all of those ad dollars, you know, are getting
31:55
bought up and everyone's spending all their money in that sector, it's basic
31:59
economics, supply and demand. The demand for that inventory is going up
32:06
exponentially, but the supply is not. So, what's that
32:10
going to mean? Well, Google CPC has increased 174% in the last 5 years,
32:16
right? There's all these businesses that are flooding online to advertise their
32:21
business because all of the attention has flooded online and people are
32:26
following that attention. They're following that eyeballs. And now what
32:29
you're seeing is okay, the cost per click goes from $12.
32:33
Then it jumps up the next year to $155 and then to 214 and then to $269 and
32:40
then to $280. Right? So what you're seeing is that because the cost per
32:46
click on that channel has risen by 174%. In all the other variables to stay the
32:51
same, your cost to acquire a lead has just gone up by 174%. And therefore your
32:57
cost to acquire a customer on that channel has gone up by
33:02
174%. Right? And that is just eroding your
33:06
margins. are just getting chomped away like a sea of ferocious piranhas on your
33:11
bottom line. And this isn't just Google. Facebook's cost per click has increased
33:16
by 171%. Over the last 12 months, right? And what
33:22
you're seeing there is Facebook is reaching what we call max ad lobe. This
33:28
is an article from Recode. Facebook says it's running out of places in the news
33:32
feed to show people ads. Facebook relaunches search ads to offset slowing
33:37
revenue. Instagram is already running out of room for ads and that's a threat
33:44
to Facebook as it looks for new avenues to keep their revenue growing. Right?
33:50
This means if you're already advertising on online or want to be that you need to
33:55
be a master because as everyone's flooding online and the rising costs are
34:00
going up, you need to become extremely efficient and effective with the message
34:05
that you put out on that platform in order to get one up on your competitors.
34:09
Because if everyone's on Google and they're all bidding on the same keywords
34:13
that are driving most of the search traffic in your industry, like what are
34:18
you going to do? How are you going to remain, you know,
34:23
dominant or how are you actually going to take a piece of the pie off these
34:27
much more established competitors? And the way that you do that is by coming
34:32
becoming a master and becoming more brutally effective on these platforms
34:36
than any of your competition. And that is exactly what it is that you're going
34:42
to be getting inside this program. you are going to be getting a master master
34:47
level understanding of you know how to go out there and get customers in
34:53
today's new digital economy right this program quantum growth is everything
35:00
that I have learned and perfected through trial and error of spending more
35:05
than $und00 million on paid advertising and way more than that on organic you
35:12
know traffic and building out sales funnels and learning copywriting and
35:16
persuasion and human psychology and I'm literally packaged up everything from
35:23
applying it to business, you know, one on one and actually deploying it and
35:27
building out funnels from scratch and split testing every little nuance and
35:33
every little element to find out scientifically what works and what
35:39
doesn't. Right? I am not just some armchair guru who's just created some
35:45
pixie dust course. I am someone who is a practitioner. I have been in the
35:50
trenches on the front lines of digital marketing, on business growth, on
35:54
capitalism really for the last 17 years of my life, getting my teeth kicked in
36:00
and learning through trial and error and losing millions and millions of dollars
36:06
in order to actually refine this system that you're going to be getting over the
36:10
coming weeks, right? And I have really thought about all the different nuances
36:16
of all the different platforms and persuasion and all the different things
36:19
that I could possibly hand to you to help you really get that trajectory and
36:25
to experience that growth that that I have experienced that you know hundreds
36:29
and hundreds of my clients have experienced firsthand but in a much
36:33
shorter window of time and without any of that trial and error that I had to go
36:38
through and giving you something that is as plug and play as possible. For you
36:43
just to go and plug into your business and just watch it just explode and
36:48
really move you from this old paradigm and this old way of doing business and
36:53
helping you experience quantum growth and growing you to a whole new
36:58
dimension, a whole new paradigm and help your business reach heights that you
37:02
didn't even know were possible. that you're going to really be, you know, me
37:06
pulling back the curtain and showing you what's possible throughout this course
37:10
and throughout me really mentoring you and showing you the way. But the
37:15
important things to remember going into this is that this will not be easy. I am
37:21
going to challenge you and push you to transcend to another level that you
37:27
didn't even know existed. Right? We're going to be covering a broad range of
37:32
topics and strategies to help you grow as a person and as an entrepreneur.
37:38
This program is designed to breed a terrorizing species of polymath that
37:44
really dominate every market that they operate in. This is the education that
37:49
you've been searching for your whole life but have not been able to find. And
37:55
we're going to be going into, you know, not just the business side, not just,
38:00
you know, the Facebook ads and the funnels and how to write really
38:04
compelling webinars and all of that kind of stuff, but I'm going to be really
38:08
helping you to create a new you. Because if you want a better business, then you
38:15
need to be better as an individual. Now, wherever you are and however hard that
38:20
you're working right now, I want you to take it to another level that you didn't
38:25
even know was possible, I really want to push you to get into that zone where you
38:30
can shut out all the noise and negativity and the fear and the
38:34
distraction and lies and just achieve all that you want to in whatever it is
38:40
that you do. I want you to really light a fire inside yourself so big and so
38:45
ablaze that nobody can deny you. Right? In business and in life, there are a
38:52
multitude of factors that are outside of your control. Like how wellunded your
38:57
competitors are or the size and the experience of their team or how much
39:01
money that they've got to spend on marketing or when they got started in
39:05
business or their joint venture partners. All of this is outside of your
39:11
control. The thing that is within your control is how hard you work. Now, in
39:18
anything that you do, it takes no talent. It takes no luck or any other
39:22
resources to work hard, right? You just have to be willing to put in the work
39:28
and actually do it and execute every single day. There are no excuses and
39:33
it's no one else's fault. It's all on you, right? So you must get completely
39:40
focused on taking full ownership and responsibility for every bit of success
39:45
and every bit of failure that comes your way. Right? You decide to basically get
39:51
the job done and what it's going to take to get the job done and then do whatever
39:56
is necessary to make it happen. When you make a mistake, do not look for
40:02
excuses. Do not blame other people. Do not blame the course. Just own it. 100%
40:09
because I've used these strategies in this course to help generate over $1.33
40:15
billion in revenue in over 416 different niches and industries that
40:22
I've deployed them in. So, this stuff is incredibly powerful and it works, but it
40:26
only works if you work right. So from this point on, there will be no
40:33
complaining. There will be no bitching. There will be no moaning. And there will
40:37
be no negativity, right? None of that stuff is going to be tolerated inside
40:41
this community of hungry winners, right? The only thing that's going to be
40:46
tolerated is taking violent action towards your goals. Because we've got
40:51
this Facebook community that's going to be attached to this. And you know, there
40:55
are so many people in life that just look for excuses. They look to blame
40:59
something that's outside of their power. They look to blame their competitors and
41:04
all that kind of stuff, right? But the one thing that is common is that winners
41:08
always find a way. And I'm giving you my way that I know works without a shadow
41:13
of a doubt because I personally deployed it for hundreds of clients in over 416
41:19
different industries and niches. So if you do the work and you execute, then
41:23
you will get phenomenal output from this. And the other thing that I want to
41:28
highlight is that complexity is the enemy of execution. So throughout this
41:33
course you will see that I try try to boil down complex things into simple and
41:40
actionable steps for you and that is because complexity is the enemy of
41:44
execution and it's not about having the most complex salesunnel in the world
41:49
with thousands and thousands and hundreds of different contingency
41:53
campaigns and rules and if not boxes. That [ __ ] is stupid. And only broke
41:59
people obsess over those things because I've seen simple two-step funnels go out
42:04
there and take people from doing, you know, 400 grand to doing 3 million in a
42:09
year or from people that are doing 3 million and blowing them up to 25
42:13
million in 18 months, right? So only broke people obsess over the technology
42:20
and all the little nuances and the brand new like little tools and hacks that you
42:25

Video 1.3 Transcript

Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to this module called Valley of Kings.
0:16
And today's training is about specifically focusing on the end outcome
0:21
that we are trying to achieve, where we're trying to get to before we dive
0:26
into the specific strategies and tactics of how to grow our traffic and then get
0:30
more leads and convert those leads into actually highpaying clients. Because the
0:35
truth is that none of that stuff matters if we are not clear on the destination
0:40
that we're trying to arrive at. So let's look at what we'll be covering in
0:44
today's training. We'll be going through starting with the
0:48
end in mind then thirdwave lifestyle design the north star the golden ratio
0:54
and also the weighing of souls. The process for the Valley of Kings is
1:00
really to start with the end in mind. Because what I see far too often in
1:06
business is that a business owner, an entrepreneur will start a business
1:10
without really thinking about exactly what it is that they're trying to do and
1:15
what they're trying to achieve and where they are trying to go and therefore they
1:21
are not optimizing for an outcome. Like wanting to grow your business is not
1:27
starting with the end in the mind or just saying I want to just grow my
1:30
business till I've got a th000 customers and a million in revenue or $10 million.
1:36
What is that for? What is the actual end destination that you're trying to arrive
1:40
at? And and actually why why are you trying to get there? So what I like to
1:46
do in any situation is to start with the end in mind and that is where am I
1:53
trying to go? That's the question that I ask myself. What is it that I'm trying
1:58
to achieve? Because once I know this, I can then map out a route of how to get
2:03
there. But without a clear without getting clear on this, you simply can't
2:08
optimize for the outcome that you want because you're not feeding your
2:11
subconscious the input it needs in order to help you manifest it. If you don't
2:16
know what it looks like, what does that promised land look like? How do you know
2:21
how to get there? How can you even create a plan to get there? Because you
2:25
don't even know where you're trying to get to. So you you really need to put
2:29
some serious deep thought into where it is that you want to go. This isn't
2:35
something that you want to rush into just so you can like rush into all the
2:40
sexy marketing stuff or running Facebook ads or the funnels and all that stuff
2:44
we'll be covering in this program because none of that [ __ ] matters
2:47
without this, right? This is the single most important thing in the whole of
2:54
business. I know that's a big statement to make,
2:58
but it's true because this is what all the activities and the actions that you
3:04
take every day are going towards. And if you're not clear on where you're trying
3:09
to go to, then none of that stuff matters. You're just like violently
3:13
executing on stuff blindly and spinning around in a room and you don't know
3:17
where you're trying to go and it just doesn't make any sense at all.
3:21
So the most important thing is getting clear on where it is that you're trying
3:26
to go. And this can be a really hard thing to figure out without having like
3:30
a framework and a process. Because often time when I meet with people and I ask
3:36
them this question like where is it that you're trying to go? What is it that
3:39
you're trying to achieve? They generally regurgitate some stuff that isn't the
3:44
destination. It's more so things that they're trying to attain or individual
3:50
key milestones, but it's not the actual destination.
3:56
So, let me run you through my process of of how I figure this out. And it's using
4:03
something that I call thirdwave lifestyle design. Now, when most people
4:08
think of lifestyle design, they think of a beach and like a hammock and just
4:13
doing nothing all day, just sipping pina coladas. But people find out very
4:18
quickly, if they've ever been in a position to do that, that this all
4:22
sounds really good, but it gets old very quickly. And it isn't really a
4:28
fulfilling life that results in you living up to your full potential.
4:33
Then you have like the second wave. And the second wave lifestyle design is
4:37
about like hustle, hustle, hustle. Like just keep grinding and working until
4:42
blood starts dripping from your eyes. And sleep doesn't matter. You just need
4:46
to hit more coffee and like just work hard, play hard. Go go go go go go.
4:51
Hustle hustle hustle. There's no importance placed on like renewal
4:55
rituals or sleep or diet or exercise. Now that [ __ ] is a recipe for disaster.
5:04
Don't get me wrong, like I work incredibly hard and I firmly believe
5:07
that nothing great is possible without a lot of hard work. However, thirdwave
5:13
lifestyle design is the most superior method for the art of living. Now, let
5:19
me ask you, when was the last time that you sat down and actually designed your
5:26
perfect lifestyle rather than have like the demands of your everyday life
5:31
dictate how you live your life? Like, when was the last time that you sat down
5:36
and actually planned it? If you're like most, you might have never ever done
5:41
this before. Thirdwave lifestyle design is just that.
5:46
Like an architect, it's about sitting down and designing the ultimate life
5:51
that you want. Most people structure their life around working 5 days a week
5:56
and then they indulge in some forget the work week behavior like getting drunk or
6:01
taking drugs or smoking weed and doing all types of stupid stuff, right? their
6:07
life isn't designed and built properly because who in their right mind would
6:11
design a life where only two days out of seven are enjoyable? It literally makes
6:17
zero sense. So let's take a look at how the average person spends a working day.
6:24
32% of their time goes towards sleeping which is 7.6 hours. Then 37% of their
6:32
time is working and related activities which is 8.8. 8 hours.
6:38
2.5 hours is like leisure and sports. 1.1 hours or 5% is household activities.
6:48
1.1 hours or another 5% is eating and drinking. Another 5% 1.2 hours is caring
6:57
for others. And the other 7%
7:02
1.2 two hours is just on other erroneous kind of tasks, right? So 10%
7:10
of your entire day is spent on leisure activities.
7:16
This is a horrible way to live, right? So if you could design your life, what
7:22
would it look like? The problem with that question is that when you sit down
7:27
and try to do this, it's a daunting task and it's usually not a very productive
7:32
exercise because it's just such a big question, right? Like what does the
7:36
ideal life look like? What would you be doing? There's just so many different
7:42
moving parts. So instead, what I found works a lot better is to ask yourself,
7:48
what does the perfect day look like? It's a lot more tangible, real, and
7:53
actionable. And it's a lot easier to break down 24 hours than it is like your
7:58
entire life. And that way, we're reverse engineering your dream life. Because,
8:05
you know, the days are going to make up the weeks that are going to make up the
8:08
months. They're going to make up the years. They're going to make up the
8:10
decades that are going to make up your entire life. So, the first building
8:14
block is really the day, right? Like, what does the dream day look like? So,
8:19
what does that perfect day look like for you? And it starts with asking yourself
8:25
questions like, what time do you wake up? Do you wake up with alarm or no
8:31
alarm? How many hours of sleep do you get per night? Like, do you know what is
8:36
the optimum amount of sleep for yourself that you function on that you would like
8:39
to get every single night? is you were sitting down and planning out the
8:44
perfect day. What do you do as soon as you wake up?
8:48
Do you go for a workout, for a run? Do you take your kids for a walk or the
8:53
dog? Do you meditate as opposed to just like checking your
8:56
phone and diving straight into work bushfires and emails and social media
9:01
and all the the chaotic blizzard of activity that is that stuff?
9:06
What do you eat for breakfast? Where do you eat it? Is it at a cafe? Is it at
9:11
home? Do you go out, you know, with your husband or with your wife or with your
9:16
partner or whoever that may be? And do you sit down and have an enjoyable
9:21
breakfast with them? Or do you rush off to work or do you never get to see your
9:25
partner? What time do you start work and what do
9:30
you choose to work on? That's a really, really important one. having the ability
9:36
to choose what you work on and not letting the squeakiest wheel get the
9:41
grease. Do you know what I mean? Like looking really what it is that you enjoy
9:45
working on. What are the things that you gain a lot of pleasure about when you're
9:50
working on them in your business? Again, we're we're designing our perfect day.
9:54
What projects are you working on in your business? You know, how does that look?
10:00
What goals are you trying to hit? Where are you trying to go? This comes down to
10:05
this key question because what you do every day is going to be centered around
10:10
where it is that you're trying to go and what is it that you're trying to do and
10:13
what goals you're trying to attain. What time do you eat lunch? What do you
10:20
eat? Where do you eat it and with whom? Or do you work out at midday to break up
10:24
your day? You know, do you meet up with your friends for for an extended lunch?
10:29
Do you have a short lunch so you can go home early? Do you go hit the gym in the
10:35
day to break up your day? If you had the perfect, you know, day, if you could
10:40
structure it any way that you want, not based on your current limitations. I
10:45
don't want that stuff to hold you back. I want you to think about what does the
10:48
dream day look like, the perfect day for you. What would be gain the most
10:52
pleasure and get you the best output for where you want to go and what you want
10:56
to be doing with your life? Do you have an activity that you do every day
11:01
slashweek? Do you play golf on Tuesday afternoons or do you take the kids for
11:06
the swim or a dog or take your partner for a yoga class or do you go out and do
11:11
a cooking class? Whatever it is, what is it? Is it something that you do every
11:14
day or is it something that you do every week? And what is it? How long do you do
11:18
it for? Who do you do it with? What is it? If you weren't limited by money, if
11:25
you weren't limited by your geography or all these different kind of things that
11:31
are present in your current life, that's not what we're doing. We're not talking
11:35
about crafting the perfect day around the confinements of your current
11:39
business and the way that you've got things set up or how much money that you
11:42
earn or how much time that you have and how big your team is. We're talking
11:46
about the perfect day if you had a blank canvas with no limitations.
11:54
What do you choose to work on for the rest of the day after you have lunch?
11:58
So, after you've come back from lunch or you've come back from the gym, what is
12:01
it you choose to to work on for the rest of the day? Do you have a team? If so,
12:06
who's on your team? What do they take off your plate? What is the culture like
12:11
in your company? Who are these people? How much do you trust them? Are they
12:16
like family? Do you love them? Do you want to look after them and care for
12:20
them because they're so good to you and they help make all your dreams a
12:24
reality? These are all things you need to think
12:28
about when crafting that perfect day. Who who is your team? Who is it made up
12:32
of? How many people are on there? What do they free you up for you to be able
12:37
to work on? What time do you finish working for the
12:42
day? This is a really important one. You know, is your work something that
12:47
just it comes with you everywhere you go? Do you finish and then close it off?
12:52
Do you really enjoy finishing work? If so, that's maybe a telltale sign that
12:58
you're not hugely passionate about what you're doing. But whatever it is, like
13:02
what time do you finish work for the day? Do you finish at 2:00? Do you
13:06
finish at 4? Do you finish at 8? Do you finish a bit earlier so you can pick up
13:11
your children or go do other activities or hang out with your partner? Whatever
13:16
that looks like for you, you need to get clear on what that is.
13:22
What do you do after work? Is your office close to home? Or do you have a
13:26
home office? What do you do? Do you commute? Is it very close by? Can you
13:31
walk or ride a push bike? These are things that you want to be thinking
13:35
about. What do you do to decompress for the
13:38
day? Do you hit a sauna, take the dog for a walk, catch up with friends,
13:42
family, kids? What does that decompression time look like for you?
13:48
How are you renewing your energy? You know, it's unrealistic to think that
13:54
you can just, you know, go a million miles an hour forever and not have these
13:58
rituals that you bake into your life that allow you to really perform at
14:03
optimum levels. What time do you eat dinner? What do you
14:08
eat with whom? Who prepares it? What are you doing? Again, do you have a family
14:13
dinner? Do you not have a family? Do you go out to incredible restaurants every
14:18
night? Whatever that dream perfect day looks like for you, you need to
14:23
architect it. You need to get clear on what it looks like. What time do you go
14:26
to bed? What is your night ritual? Do you have no screens past 7 p.m.? Do you
14:30
meditate? Do you watch documentaries, play board games or how or or cards or
14:35
whatever it might be? Again, get clear on having that time really documented.
14:43
Do you go to bed at midnight every night? Who knows? I don't know what the
14:47
output might look like for you and what you would ideally like to be doing. You
14:51
might be in a situation right now where you have to go to bed early or you might
14:57
have to go to bed really late because you've got a whole bunch of admin work
15:00
that you've got to do until late at night so you can be running the business
15:05
during the day. Whatever it looks like, you have to think about what would be
15:10
optimum for you if you didn't have a lack of resources or any of the
15:16
restrictions that might be placed on you right now.
15:21
Now this is a quote by Lawrence Pceljax. A master in the art of living draws no
15:28
sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his
15:34
mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is
15:41
which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing
15:48
and leaves no others to determine whether he is working or playing to
15:53
himself. He always appears to be doing both. Now I love this quote because
16:00
third way thirdwave lifestyle design is really about the art of living. That's
16:05
right. There is an art to living a rich life. People are always talking about
16:11
work life balance and this concept has never really resonated with me because
16:16
when people ask me or subre like how many hours do you work a week I tell
16:21
them from the moment my eyes open to the moment that they close at night because
16:26
for me there really isn't any distinction between labor and leisure.
16:31
I'm deeply passionate about growing businesses and helping others start and
16:36
grow businesses. This is my life's work and what constantly occupies my mind
16:41
because I love what I do and the life that I live. But none of this happened
16:47
by accident. I have designed my life in a way to support this and that supports
16:53
me being able to live out my passion. I've got a family. I've got two amazing
17:00
little girls, a beautiful wife. I work out my mind and my body every day. And I
17:06
run a rapidly growing company with a team of 70 plus people. Now whether I'm
17:12
in the office or not, I am working. I am constantly scheming and plotting and
17:18
pondering and thinking about how to get to the next level in all areas of my
17:23
life. Because when the why is defined and it's big, the how becomes easy. And
17:30
we've all got the same 24 hours in a day. So the excuse about time is
17:36
irrelevant. If something is important to you, you will make the time. You know,
17:41
I'm up at 4:00 a.m. making the time. I have yearly goals that are broken down
17:48
into quarterly targets and then projects that go to adding up to me hitting those
17:54
goals. And I work intensely for 90day sprints. I block out all the noise.
18:00
every little hour is really itemized and allocated towards on my calendars. And
18:06
then I take holidays every quarter. You know, I love traveling. I love eating at
18:12
incredible restaurants. These are, you know, photos of me taking my my family
18:16
to like, you know, Marrakesh and going camel riding and, you know, places that
18:22
I've stayed. And I also have, you know, I take my entire team, you know, on all
18:28
expenses holidays, you know, to Bali and Thailand. And people ask me like, why?
18:33
Like, why do you do that? And and my answer to that is why not? Like this is
18:37
my life. This is what I'm doing every day. And you know, I'm out there
18:41
building a business that supports this life. And I want to take my team
18:45
overseas. They're awesome. You know, I love them. They do great work. And I
18:50
want to celebrate in the spoils with them. And all of this stuff is really
18:56
possible because I have made it possible and because of I've architected this in
19:01
my mind of the things that I want to do and what I want to achieve. It just
19:06
doesn't happen by chance like oh let me just you know take 70 people over to
19:10
Thailand. It doesn't happen like that. It's all happened because that's the
19:15
kind of lifestyle that I have actively designed for myself. And all these
19:20
activities are centered around me navigating towards my north star.
19:28
And your north star is really your true north. It's what you're trying to
19:33
optimize for and what it is that you're trying to achieve. and can be best
19:38
defined by asking yourself these three really important questions.
19:44
That is where are you trying to go? What do you want to achieve and why? So
19:51
let me break these down. So where are you trying to go? What does the desired
19:56
destination look like for you? That perfect day formula exercise that you
20:01
just went through. you know, vividly writing down and getting clear of where
20:06
it is that you're trying to go. And I've included a a a document in the resources
20:12
section to a Google doc where it has all of those questions for the perfect day
20:16
formula that you can go in and fill that out. And that's something that you
20:19
really need to take the time and do. The next one is what do you want to
20:25
achieve? What is it that that you want to achieve? If it's a revenue number for
20:29
your business, what is it? If it's impact, make it measurable, i.e. to like
20:34
feed 10,000 people. If it's a house or being able to retire your parents or pay
20:39
off their mortgage or help out, you know, one of your brothers or sisters,
20:44
you need to get very specific of what it is. And it doesn't only have to be
20:50
monetary, you know, impact. It can be anything that you want, but it can't be
20:54
some esoteric statement. It needs to be real. It needs to be tangible. And then
20:59
the last one is why. This is really an incredibly important
21:05
one. Now, we'll be going to this like in in really really deep detail um in in
21:12
week two and really in the in the mindset modules and there will be a
21:17
whole week dedicated to this because if you're not clear on your why, you will
21:23
simply lose motivation when things get difficult because you'll lose steam and
21:28
you'll just give up and like quit your business and close it down and become an
21:32
Uber driver because things get really really hard in business, right? There
21:36
are going to be many setbacks, many things that happen along the way that
21:40
you didn't really envision happening, but that do happen. And if you don't
21:46
know why you're doing it all, you're just going to quit because it's just
21:50
going to be far too hard right, it's going to be so much easier to quit than
21:56
it is to keep going if you're not clear on your why. And I will show you how to
22:01
neurally imprint this into your mind so you become an unstoppable force of
22:07
nature. And this is really is the key because all of the marketing stuff and
22:12
all of that stuff, it doesn't matter if you're just going to fold like a pack of
22:17
cards every time that you meet resistance because there's going to be
22:22
lots of it. So getting clear on your why and then really imprinting it into your
22:27
brain and making yourself like an unstoppable force is really a secret
22:31
weapon. And I'm going to show you exactly how to do that. But a quick
22:36
takeaway in the meantime before we really dive into all of that stuff in
22:41
the coming modules is you really need to have your why so big that the how
22:48
becomes easy. Right? So you want to make it that
22:53
whatever it is that you're trying to achieve is so important to you that the
23:00
how of how to achieve it becomes easy because the why is just so big and it's
23:05
like I will run through walls. I will jump off buildings to get to this thing
23:11
cuz it is so important to me and the actual what you need to do and the how
23:17
of it becomes really easy. Right? But for now, we simply want to get clear
23:22
about what it is that we want. And then we want to figure out what it's going to
23:27
take to go out and achieve this. Which brings us to the golden ratio. Now, the
23:33
golden ratio is all about figuring out exactly how much money and resources
23:40
that you will need in order to support your ideal lifestyle and obtain your
23:45
goals. Most people write down like arbitrary numbers like I want to hit a
23:50
million dollars per year. Like this is the the number one number if you ask
23:54
anybody that's not, you know, at that, you know, seven figure level yet. Like
23:58
how much revenue do they'll never give you like I want to do $833,000 a year.
24:03
It's always a million. It's just some arbitrary round number. And these
24:08
numbers are usually preconditioned by society and are not in fact your number.
24:15
You can tell whenever somebody hasn't given much thought to their lifestyle or
24:19
their income requirements because their number ends in a zero. That means that
24:23
they haven't run the numbers and they don't really know what they're trying to
24:27
achieve. And how can you ever achieve the life that you want if you are not
24:33
clear on what it is and what is involved in order for you to manifest that and
24:40
make it a reality. Right? So the way that we do that is one, we
24:46
use the perfect day formula worksheet and we get very very clear on exactly
24:52
what it is that we want. Right? Then after we've done that in forensic like
24:58
detail and we've gone through all the different nuances and we make it so
25:02
visceral that we can imagine living out that perfect day. We can like smell what
25:09
it would smell like. we can feel what it's going to feel like based on what it
25:13
is that we're trying to architect for ourself. And then the next step is by
25:18
using the lifestyle calculator and figuring out how much it's going to cost
25:24
you exactly to live that perfect day. So, I'll get out of this and I'll just
25:30
show you what that quickly looks like. All right, guys. So, what we have here
25:36
is the King Kong lifestyle calculator. And this is a Google sheet and there's a
25:41
link to this in the resource resource section of this module. And basically
25:46
what it is is a lifestyle calculator for you to start going in here and
25:51
populating you know what it is that your monthly expenses are or what they are
25:56
going to be in order for you to live that dream day and what that life looks
26:02
like for you. So we might say okay your rent is going to be 3500. Now, you you
26:07
may rent, you may you might own a home, whatever it is that's going to, you
26:11
know, give give you the most pleasurable day and the lifestyle that you want. Um,
26:17
now these figures, I've just just thrown them in there basically, right? You
26:21
might be wanting to live in a mansion, in the city, you might be wanting to
26:24
live by the beach, in the country, whatever it is, you need to kind of get
26:29
clear of what it's going to cost you in order to achieve that. Um, so we've put
26:33
these two figures in here. There might be property tax on here, repair and
26:37
maintenance. We might say, "Cool. We're going to spend, you know, $150 per month
26:42
on maintenance. We're going to have a house cleaner that comes and cleans our
26:46
house um every week. That's going to cost us $280. Then we'll have somebody
26:51
that comes and does the lawns and all of that stuff and any garden maintenance
26:55
and that's going to cost us another $150." And then it's just calculating
26:58
here. It's giving, okay, cool. That's going to cost you 6K per month. And then
27:03
you want to look at your electricity and your utilities and then health care and
27:07
like how much do you spend on groceries? Do you drink? If you do, how much do you
27:11
spend on that? How how what are you going to spend on clothes and getting
27:15
your haircuts or dry cleaning or makeup or whatever it might be? How much do you
27:20
spend um in Ubers and taxis and da da um and you can see there's lots of stuff on
27:26
here like Netflix and video games and you know I basically tried to think of
27:30
all the different things that could be costing you money right now. Um so you
27:35
can add them all in here and then it's going to give you at the end like
27:40
essentially what the annual costs are going to be, right? And it's going to
27:43
estimate all of this for you. Um, and you can put whatever you like, you know,
27:48
whatever it's going to be for you. Are you single? You married that, you know,
27:51
that's going to affect, you know, your lifestyle and what your dream day looks
27:54
like. And then it's going to get you like your monthly debt and all of that.
27:57
You can see down here that you go down further, it's like how much work do I
28:04
need to do to earn that, right? And you can put in here like what your current
28:09
hourly rate is and like how much money that you're getting paid or you can
28:13
figure out like hours of paid work to meet income annually and you can start
28:18
to reverse engineer what it is, right? It becomes something
28:23
that is esoteric into something that is real. Then we've got debt. You can put
28:27
how much debt that you've got on your credit cards. You know, what are your
28:30
business expenses? How much are you spending on rent? All of that. And then
28:34
what it's going to do, it's going to spit out exactly,
28:39
you know, how much it's going to cost to fund your ideal lifestyle. So, I haven't
28:46
gone in here and filled out everything. I'm going to leave this up to you guys
28:48
to go down. And this will be an eyeopening experience. I can tell you
28:52
right now that if you complete this, you will be in the 0.00001% 0000001%
28:58
of all business owners out there that has a very clear goal of what is it that
29:03
they are actually trying to achieve and how do they make that a reality? What
29:08
does it cost for them to run their life when they have the ideal lifestyle and
29:14
the ideal dream day? So yeah, you really want to go ahead spend the time. I know
29:20
it's not the sexiest thing, but nothing is more sexy than hitting your goals.
29:24
And this thing is really going to allow that to basically become a reality. So
29:29
go ahead and and really you know after you finish this module is go ahead and
29:34
actually do it get it done. Now after that you have worked out your
29:40
number as I say you need to start with the end in mind and then work backward
29:45
backwards from that number. Now you need to think about what it will take in
29:50
order to achieve this. how much revenue, how many clients you will need in order
29:54
to hit that income target, and then work out how many new clients that you're
29:58
going to need per month, right? And once you've gone through all of that and you
30:03
you started with the end in mind and you say, "Okay, cool. This is how much money
30:07
that I'm going to need to earn per year in order for me to be able to fund my
30:12
ideal lifestyle and live really live my perfect day and my dream day." Then you
30:18
know then you can start to really figure out okay I need to earn that much
30:23
personally how much revenue will my business need to do and if my business
30:27
you know does that amount of revenue and then I pay taxes and then I've got to
30:31
pay for employees and payroll tax and all of that kind of stuff then you know
30:36
how much is going to be left over am I am I going to hit that target and this
30:41
is when it brings us to the weighing of souls and that is once you've done your
30:44
perfect day formula and have your number you'll be left with the decision of
30:48
choosing one of two options and that is really do I operate as a hunter gatherer
30:56
and a one-man army or do I become a farmer and build a battalion of soldiers
31:03
to help me right and that's going to basically be like am I going to be able
31:07
to achieve that lifestyle and that kind of revenue and that income just by
31:13
myself or do I need to build something that is bigger than me in in order for
31:17
me to be able to reach that number. Now, hunter gatherers feed on what business
31:23
they can find. It's really feast and famine. While a business builder and a
31:28
farmer, you are planting seeds and hope for a good harvest. And if you've
31:33
chosen, you know, a fertile market, a good niche, you will reap an abundant
31:38
harvest. Your property and and your business as an asset will go up in
31:43
value. Should you choose, you know, to leave for greener pastures, you can sell
31:49
your business living off the land, you know, one-man army, hunter gatherers,
31:54
you have nothing to sell. You know, you can migrate like with the changing
31:58
season. And this analogy is really like, do you
32:02
go like and build just a one-man army? Are you like a little freelancer or are
32:07
you a farmer? Do you really build something that's a lot bigger than just
32:11
that one person and just yourself and just delivering the work yourself and
32:16
getting paid, right? And living off the land as I call it. That's a one-man army
32:22
hunter gatherer and like you've got nothing. There's no asset that you're
32:25
really building because it's just you. But you can migrate with Changing of
32:30
Seasons. There's a lot of things, a lot of pros to also doing like both models.
32:36
And it's a really important question to ask yourself. And I can't stress enough
32:41
that you really need to take the time and ponder long and hard. Don't just
32:46
rush into this and say, "Oh yeah, I definitely want to to get a sexy office
32:50
and build a team or yeah, I love working in my pajamas from my lounge room."
32:55
Because usually when you start a business like when I started I was
32:59
working you know from my bedroom and there was a lot of pros to that right
33:04
there was like not having to manage people and like there's there's a long
33:09
list of things that I'll get into in just a moment but realistically you
33:13
don't want to think about just where you're at in this moment of time. You
33:17
want to think you want to future pace and think out further of like what does
33:22
that look like? You need to think long term, like further down the line, either
33:27
when you have kids or if you already have kids or when they move out or if
33:32
you don't want to have kids when you get older and your lifestyle might change.
33:36
This comes down to, you know, really how certain that you are on reaching that
33:44
north star. Like how much do you want it, right? You need to ask yourself how
33:49
much do you really want, what that perfect day looks like for you, and that
33:55
number that you're going to need to reach in order to fund that lifestyle.
34:00
And this is going to determine which path that you walk down when you're
34:03
weighing souls. So, let's take a look at the pros and cons of of both paths and
34:09
both models. So, first we'll look at the huntergatherer.
34:13
So, you know, you have freedom and flexibility and it's relatively simple
34:19
and stress-free. It's just yourself. There's no one else to manage. You know,
34:23
you can kind of just run your own ship and not have to really look after
34:28
anybody else and worry about how they're feeling or the quality of work that
34:33
they're putting. It's just yourself. Low overheads and it's highly
34:38
profitable, right? You know, you're typically working from home or some kind
34:42
of co-working space and you can really minimize the overheads and keep this
34:48
thing super super lean where it's almost all the revenue you generate is profit.
34:56
And you get to mostly focus on, you know, your craft and like that's very
35:03
important for a lot of hunter gatherers. They really want to just mostly focus on
35:06
their craft and they really in they love and they fall in love really with doing
35:11
the work and that's something that's really important to them and you know if
35:16
that's something that is really important to you and you just literally
35:20
you know only want to just be focusing on your craft day in day out then this
35:25
is definitely a very great model where you know as you really build the
35:28
business you become a manager of people you still have to be able to do the work
35:32
and you still do do the work but It's not like being a hunter gatherer where
35:36
it's like literally all you do is do the work.
35:40
You are location independent. That's important for a lot of people.
35:44
Typically, you know, with the technology that's available in today's day and age,
35:48
you can travel through Southeast Asia or Europe and and still do your work like
35:53
this. There's, you know, there's hundreds of thousands of digital nomads
35:56
all around the world. And it's incredible, you know, where it is that
36:00
you can live and what kind of lifestyle that you can live. you know, being a
36:03
hunter gatherer. And that's definitely a huge huge draw card for going down that
36:08
road. There's very little complexity. There's not many moving parts. Again,
36:13
it's just you. You know, some some of the downsides are
36:17
like it's feast or famine. Typically, it's just yourself. You know, it's like
36:24
you can't ever really do serious marketing because you you get a number
36:28
of clients and then you very quickly hit capacity. And so you you kind of mainly
36:35
operate off referrals and word of mouth. And some months it's really good. Like
36:39
you might have two or three people that are waiting in line to do work with you.
36:42
And then there might be two or three months where there isn't any work. And
36:46
it's really kind of that yo-yo, that up and down feast of famine. And that
36:50
really can, you know, affect your income.
36:54
You know, you can't really take holidays because every time that you take a
36:58
holiday, it's a loss of revenue. So, you can take them, but you don't continue to
37:02
earn money. Like, the the money just stops in most cases soon as you take a
37:06
holiday. Um, it really is a lifestyle business. It's not a real business. It's
37:12
a cash flow business. It's only just for you. It's based for your lifestyle.
37:16
You're never ever going to build it to a point where it's an asset and it's
37:20
something that you can sell or anyone really sees any greater value because
37:23
you've essentially created yourself a job. Um, which is nothing wrong with
37:27
that because there's a lot of, you know, the pros that we just went through about
37:31
what that enables you to do. Um, as I said, it's just it's a cash
37:36
flow business. It's no asset and it's limited scale. Like you can't scale more
37:41
than to how many hours that there are typically in a day. um if you're
37:45
delivering the work or you know whatever it might be, it's typically even your if
37:50
you're not delivering the work and it's some kind of online course or or or what
37:54
have you, there's limited scale, right? This there's only so much that one
37:58
person can do all by themselves and you really hit that limit very very quickly.
38:05
Now let's look at the other path or the other model which is a farmer which is
38:09
really a business builder, right? And you know, you kind of have limited
38:15
flexibility in the beginning for this model because it's like you you can't go
38:21
out and and go away on holiday or you can't have much flexibility because this
38:27
business requires a lot of attention in the beginning. There's other people in
38:31
it. There's other human beings helping you grow this thing and they need a lot
38:37
of attention and a lot of care in order for things to go as planned. So that
38:42
just limits the amount of flexibility that you have in the business.
38:48
You know, being a farmer and building a business, no matter how you look at it,
38:52
is really functioning chaos. There's so much chaos that goes into scaling a big
38:58
business. And you have to get okay with that. you you must be okay with dealing
39:04
with chaos and being able to kind of break down those complexities, take
39:08
punches in the face and keep going because the why of why you're doing it
39:12
is all worthwhile at the end of the day. Um, high overheads, less profitable.
39:18
You're going to need an office. you're going to need to buy computers and
39:22
workstations and pay for employees and then pay for their payroll tax and their
39:27
holidays and, you know, bonuses and like increases in their salary. There's a lot
39:32
of different things that come into it. Um, and you know, unless you're a savvy
39:38
operator, you know, it can become, you know, very very very lean in terms of
39:45
the amount of profitability and profit that you're generating as a business.
39:50
um you're mostly focused on building your team. As I said, you're not really
39:54
focused on your craft and you know uh your craft until you get to a certain
39:58
stage, right? Until you you've got enough people on the team where you can
40:01
go back to the craft and go back to the things that you love. But mostly, you
40:06
know, by and large, you're going to be focused on building out your team
40:10
fixed location. More often than not, you're going to have an office. There's
40:14
going to be people that are going to need to live in proximity to that
40:16
office. Yes, you can go, you know, fully remote and that's a model that you can
40:21
go down, but you know, it's rare to see a company that's has a phenomenal
40:26
culture and has been able to achieve amazing things working remotely. And
40:32
there definitely are a handful. There's a lot of companies that I know that have
40:35
built remote teams, but they are by and large a dime a dozen if you compare to
40:42
the whole spectrum of great companies that have ever been built and the ones
40:46
that have physical locations and an office with a culture of people in
40:51
there, you know, all working towards and striving towards hitting one goal as
40:55
that they are, you know, working completely remotely. So, more often than
40:59
not, you're going to have a fixed location of where it is that you're
41:01
operating from. There is high complexity because when
41:06
you're building a service base or a coaching or consulting business, any
41:09
business that's really delivering a service for a fee, you are going to be
41:14
in the business of basically scaling human beings and that brings a lot of
41:20
complexity to it because you're going to have teams then you're going to have
41:23
people that lead those teams and there is their emotions and there then there's
41:28
those people that are communicating with other human beings within your
41:32
organization. ation and making sure that that communication is as effective and
41:37
efficient as possible and everyone's working in a cohesive way and you've got
41:43
great culture and people are getting along. So yeah, there's a high level of
41:47
complexity in in order to be able to do that.
41:51
And the pros are that you know the farmer eats all year round. It's not
41:57
feast or famine. you know, they can go away on holiday and they can have a
42:01
business that continues to bring in revenue and bring in new customers and,
42:07
you know, running a business that can run without you and it can run when
42:11
you're not there. And if you choose to go to go away to Europe for a month, you
42:17
can do that and come back to a business that's in as good shape, if not better,
42:22
than it was when you left it. um because you have really swallowed those
42:28
complexities and have operated in that functioning chaos to build that
42:32
business. So it enables you to do that. Um you know you can take frequent paid
42:38
holidays as I said you know I take holidays every 90 days and typically go
42:42
overseas with my family. Um I would not be able to do that if you know I was
42:47
just a hunter gatherer. Um you have really built a business and not a job.
42:53
there's other people in the organization that are helping you. And this is, you
42:57
know, you've really ha h have built a business, a proper business um with
43:02
other functioning people in there and that's generating value and creating
43:06
value out in the marketplace and for your clients and customers without it
43:10
all being on your shoulders. It's also a legacy business. Do you know
43:16
what I mean? something that you build for your last name and it's a valuable
43:21
asset that if you choose to go out and sell that a lot of people find a lot of
43:26
value in somebody who has been able to build a business and has all these human
43:32
beings in there and have things running like a welloiled machine and as a result
43:37
of that you know if you choose to for instance be a hunter gatherer for 5
43:41
years and then decide that you want to get out of that essentially the only
43:45
thing that you've gained throughout that time is the revenue that you have
43:48
generated and the income that you've provided yourself, but there's nothing
43:52
that you've worked towards that you can then sell for a multiple of that revenue
43:56
and cash out and move on to whatever the next thing is for you with a war chest
44:01
of money. It's just, you know, that's those businesses, they can't be sold.
44:07
It's something that is highly scalable. you know, you can put more and more
44:12
human beings into the system and and keep scaling it up and ratcheting it up
44:17
to to that next level. And really, the only limit to the scale on this is, you
44:24
know, how much of that functioning chaos that you can re in and still have the
44:29
business run in an efficient way that delivers the output of results that you
44:36
are giving to your prospects and to your client. and making sure that as you
44:41
scale up to all the levels, whether it's five team members and then 10 and then
44:45
20 and then 30 or 40 or 100 or whatever it might be, you can continue to do that
44:51
as long as you still remain to give the same output and the same results to your
44:57
clients. Um, and they're kind of, you know, all all of the the pros and the
45:02
cons that I've highlighted. And if you're a good hunter and gatherer and
45:06
you move smartly, you will stay fed and make a great living. As a hunter
45:11
gatherer, you have the opportunity to build your skill set and get paid for
45:16
doing, you know, what it is that you love to do while you master your craft.
45:22
Meanwhile, if you choose to go down like the farmer and the the business builder
45:27
angle, you know, the business builder, he eats all year round or she eats all
45:32
year round and they trade with other farmers and often hire hands to help
45:37
with the heavy lifting. And if the farmer scales things correctly, the
45:42
business doesn't solely depend on them and them as an operation. Right now, I
45:47
have tried to keep this as unbiased as possible as I've been through both
45:54
evolutions, right? And both of them have their merit. There is no one model that
45:59
is perfect. It is always what is perfect for the individual for them to reach
46:04
their end goal of wherever it is that they're trying to go. And both really do
46:10
have their pros and cons. So I really will end on it's all about designing
46:15
your life and figuring out your number and then getting crystal crystal clear
46:21
on your why. And this really dictates which path that you choose. Right? So
46:29
basically here are the action items. Start with the end in mind. Think about
46:33
where it is that you're trying to go and then back into those goals and
46:39
figure out, you know, what is the north star, like why are you trying to get
46:44
there? What does it look like for you? What does that mean for you? Then
46:47
complete the perfect day formula and fill it out with as much detail as
46:52
possible. Really make it visceral where you know it gets you so excited just to
46:58
read that thing because that's exactly what you want. And if you do that and
47:02
you you do that, it's like through the power of auto suggestion and looking at
47:06
that and then working backwards and filling out the lifestyle calculator,
47:12
then that will enable you to get crystal clear on where it is that you're going,
47:18
right? And when you know where it is that you're going, then it's like it's
47:24
so much easier for you to really get up every day and to get after it because
47:30
you know exactly what it is that you're going to war for every day to make it
47:34
happen. And when there are setbacks in your business or when a key staff member
47:38
resigns or you know when one of your competitors poaches one of your team
47:42
members or one of your employees goes out there and starts your exact same
47:47
business model because they think that they can do it all. You know those
47:51
things aren't going to get you down so much because you know where you're
47:55
going. You know what fire you're willing to walk through to get to where it is
47:59
that you want to go. So they're the action items. The resources for this
48:03
module can be found in the resources section. You got your perfect day
48:07
formula worksheet in there and also your lifestyle calculator. Please make sure
48:12
that you go ahead and complete these different tasks before I see you in the
48:16
next module. So go ahead and do that now and I will see you in the next video.

Facebook Audience Insights Tool >
1.    Where does your dream buyer hang out and congregate?
Name both online and offline places where your dream buyers hang out and congregate. The more detailed and specific, the better.
‘Hangs out on Facebook’ is too general.
‘Hangs out in the Mothers of Melbourne Facebook group’ is more precise and actionable.
‘Likes the outdoors’ is too general to mean anything insightful and actionable.
‘Likes going to the park every Saturday morning with her two kids’ shows habits and values and is specific.
‘Reads blogs’ isn’t targeted enough.
‘Obsessively reads Rockin Mama, Mamavation, and Reddit’ is defined and revealing.
Knowing exactly where your dream buyers are hanging out influences a lot of things including where you should advertise, what you should advertise, the tone of your copy, and vernacular to use.
2.  Where does your dream buyer get their information?
When your dream buyer is in research mode, where do they go to find the answers they seek? Is it Google? A particular blog? Books? Magazines? YouTube?
Write your findings as a simple sentence: ‘When Sally is curious about a topic, the first place she goes is Google search on her iPhone’.
3.  What are their biggest frustrations and challenges?
Truly understanding and empathising with their biggest frustrations and challenges are the most important keys to defining your dream buyer avatar.
By knowing what it’s like walking in your customer’s shoes, you’ll be able to create better products and services that address their specific pain points and problems.
Here are a few examples to get your creative juices flowing: ‘I wish someone would just write this sales copy for me’. ‘I need to lose ten kilos before my wedding’.
‘Ugh. I wish I could just have someone run my Facebook ads for me’.
Your dream buyer’s frustrations and challenges are integral to the products and services you offer. Whatever it is you are selling has to solve a problem large enough that your dream buyer will happily part with their hard- earned money for you to solve it for them.
Knowing their biggest frustration and challenges also will determine the emotions you speak to in your copy and advertising. There are a number of emotions behind


 
the challenges and frustrations your dream buyer is experiencing – they could be sadness, anger, fear, remorse, hope, a desire for something better. By speaking to exactly what your dream buyer is feeling, you’ll be able to connect with them emotionally on more than just a rational level.
It will also reflect the types of stories you tell. The logic here is simple. When your dream buyer sees a testimonial from a customer who solved their biggest frustrations and challenges with your product or service, then they are more likely to buy from you. They can see this positive transformation take place in someone else.


4.  What are their hopes, dreams, and desires?
Knowing your dream buyer’s hopes, dreams and desires helps you paint a vivid picture of what life could be like after using your products and services. Think of it as selling the dream and painting a picture of the Promised Land.
When your products or services help your dream buyer attain their hopes, dreams, and desires, it becomes much easier to write copy for your landing pages, website, ads, and other assets you leverage to sell more goods and services.
Here are a few examples of copy written to speak to a dream buyer’s desires:
  



 5.  What are their biggest fears?
What are your dream buyer’s deepest fears? What keeps them up at night, tossing and turning, unable to sleep? What do they worry about in their mind but never tell anyone? Fully understanding your market’s deepest and most primal fears is an often overlooked component to crafting a customer avatar. However, in my opinion, it’s equally as important, if not more, than understanding their hopes, dreams, and desires. Why? People are motivated more by pain than they are by pleasure. They are more motivated by fear of loss than they are by the desire to gain something. Therefore, calling out their fears in your copy and ads is an incredibly important element to get your dream buyer to take action and motivate them to move away from what they fear most.
A good example of fear used to motivate people into taking action is the approach used by insurance companies. They call out their prospects’ deepest fears more than they do the benefits of getting covered.
Example:
‘Life insurance can help ease your worries that your loved ones will be taken care of and may not have to deal with the financial strain that could arise from you no longer being around, or the financial hardship that can impact your kids through their surviving parent. If you have a partner, would he or she be able to take care of the kids without your help? Prevent your partner’s financial hardship affecting your kids’ welfare and future’.
6.  What is their preferred form of communication?
Email? Text? Chat? Facebook Live? Or do they prefer physical mail? This is a matter of where your audience wants you to communicate with them. The fundamental lesson here is to communicate with your customers where they already are. Don’t try and move them onto something that is more convenient for you rather than where they already are.


7.  What phrases, exact language, and vernacular do they use?


‘Enter the conversation already taking place in the customer’s mind’.
You see, there is already language and niche-specific terms being used in your customer’s mind for their hopes, dreams, pain, fears, and desires. Your job is to listen and write them down. What industry terminology are they using, what specific vernacular and niche-specific terms?
When using The Halo Strategy to conduct research on where your buyers are hanging out and congregating, you must document the exact phrases and terminology they use and store them in a spreadsheet to spark ideas for website copy, landing pages, and ads. Take specific comments from Reddit, Facebook Group, or YouTube, and document your audience’s word-for-word responses.
In today’s day and age, scepticism is rampant. Now more than ever, people are attracted to people (and businesses) who speak their language, get  their  sense  of  humour, or share the same point of view. Every time they read your copy, your goal is for your dream buyer to say to themselves, ‘Whoa, it’s like they’re talking directly to me’.
8.  What does a day in your dream buyer’s life look like?
7:05am - Mike wakes up to the sound of marimbas on his iPhone’s alarm clock.
7:15am – Checks his inbox to make sure the world isn’t coming to an end from any emails that came in overnight. Then opens up Instagram to see who’s commenting and liking his latest post.


 
8:10am - Brews the new Colombian roast using his shiny new French press.
8:32am - Stuck in traffic on Punt road listening to his favourite Drake playlist on Spotify.
9:03am - Gets into the office.
9:18am - Checks email and calendar.
10:01am – Checks the stats in Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and custom dashboard.
10:40am – Has a meeting with his team about current week.
12:05pm - Eats favourite Poké bowl from new hipster joint on the corner.
1:12pm – On his way back to the office, checks Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
2:04pm - Afternoon lull, wishing his office had a nap pod for him to have a siesta.
2:38pm – Write new Facebook Ads and email sequence.
4:05pm - Brainstorms how to generate more leads to meet quarterly growth goals and revenue targets.
6:15pm - Drives home ready for a House of Cards marathon on Netflix.
Imagining what your ideal customer’s daily life looks like adds an incredible personal element to your marketing.  It also becomes practical – when is the best time to email


 
your prospects? When are they most likely to respond? When are they most attentive?
Your dream buyer is a completely different person at 8am on a Monday morning than at 6:30pm on a Friday. Be aware of this and use it in your marketing.
9.  What makes them happy?
The customer journey is more than the exchange of money for goods and services. Your clients are emotional beings, and people want to interact with companies and brands that make them feel good about themselves.
Where are the touch points in your dream buyer’s journey where you can insert surprises, do the unexpected, be remarkable, and bring a smile to their face? Maybe it’s a handwritten thank-you note after signing up for your service, a personalised email sent on their birthday, or a free box full of company swag and cookies (who doesn’t love cookies?).
Inserting happiness into the buyer’s journey can create a deeper level of emotional connection that cultivates loyal and raving fans for the long term.








The End Result
After answering all of these questions, write a paragraph summarising your findings. It could look like this summary of Sally, the dream buyer for a new app focused on environmentally-friendly mothers:
‘Sally loves spending time reading stories and getting tips from other mums, and learning about parenthood in the Mothers of Melbourne Facebook group. It’s a much cherished pastime of hers. Her biggest frustration being a mother of two is simply that there is not enough hours in the day to do everything. When she’s in research mode, the first place she goes is Google on her iPad in the kitchen. 
She’s a frequent (kinda obsessive) visitor of mummy blogs like Rockin Mama and Mamavation. Her life-long dream is to start her own interior design business, so she can have a creative outlet and more ‘me time’. Last week when she was shopping at her local farmers market and browsing Instagram, an ad popped up with an invitation to download a new app for environmentally-friendly cleaning products’.
The end result is a much deeper, more intimate understanding of where and how to reach your dream buyers, and how to speak to them. The compounding result will cause massive breakthroughs that geometrically grow your business and allow you to dominate your market.
Defining your target market is one of the hardest parts of starting a business. The good news is that once you do it, everything else will quickly start falling into place. You just have to figure out which medium to use to effectively reach them, and which marketing strategies they respond to.

Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to week one module 3 of quantum growth.
0:17
And in this module I'm going to be diving into what I call the halo
0:21
strategy. And this is really like my secret technique just to kind of camp
0:26
out inside the mind of my dream buyer and really just gather intel that I can
0:32
use for all of my copy in new promotions and offers and anything that I'm looking
0:36
to really sell and just gives me a complete edge because it allows me just
0:41
to find out exactly what my market is starving for and then just give that to
0:46
them and talk to them in the language that they use and really enter the
0:51
conversation. that's already happening in that prospect's mind. And this is the
0:56
part of the project, this is really the part of the process where I spend, you
0:59
know, 60 to 80% of my time on when I am developing new offers and promotions or
1:05
I'm writing any copy or anything like that. And really, if you get this step
1:09
right, everything else is going to come easy. Um because it's like this is the
1:14
whole thing that is really structured around what you're going to sell, how
1:19
you're going to sell it, and who are you going to talk to, and how are you going
1:23
to talk to them. And it's really this strategy that allows me just to beat
1:28
some of the world's best copywriters and marketers in the world because I
1:33
understand the market better. Um, and I really can't stress this enough. This is
1:38
really, you know, the most powerful strategy ever for selling anything. And
1:44
you really, really need to take this research component of it very, very
1:48
seriously cuz most people don't. They're like, I don't need to research my
1:51
market. I already know what they want. Or I've been selling this for a while
1:55
and I'm seeing some success. So, you know, I already know. And it's just
1:59
something that I come across all the time, especially with business owners
2:02
and directors. They think that if they've been business for a while and
2:05
they have seen some success that they know what their market wants. And really
2:09
what you want to do is you want to put all of the judgments, all the
2:13
preconceived notions that you have about a market aside. and you want to just
2:17
literally follow this process step by step like I'm going to be running you
2:20
through today to really just go out there and have the strongest promotions,
2:25
the strongest copy that's just hardened like the tip of a spear and it just cuts
2:30
through any market and really separates you as someone that just understands
2:34
that market better than everybody. And really what I'm going to be showing you
2:38
today, it's going to just be like a a look over my shoulder as I research a
2:43
market. Just like if you were sitting in a room side by side with me and you were
2:48
like, "Okay, Sabry, what is the best way to find out what is the best thing to
2:52
sell? How to sell it? How do I really just pump up my offers on steroids and
2:56
just dominate the competition?" That's exactly what I'm going to be showing you
3:00
today. So, this is what we're going to be covering. I'm going to show you how
3:04
to identify your dream buyer. Who is that dream prospect that this really
3:09
brings in most of the revenue and most of the profit for your business? I'm
3:13
going to show you exactly how to identify them down to the tea with a
3:17
formula. Then we're also going to be running you through the the halo
3:21
strategy, like the step-by-step process that I use to do market research and
3:26
also diving inside the monkey brain. Um, this is a really really powerful
3:30
technique and it's something that really nobody else takes the time to do and if
3:36
you do it correctly allows you just to stand head and shoulders above what all
3:40
your competitors are doing. Then I'm also going to be showing you how to
3:43
create your dream buyer avatar and really just kind of represent who is
3:50
that buyer for you, that dream buyer, and not just like the usual crap like,
3:53
oh, they're this old and they live in this city and they earn this much money.
3:57
That's all the real surface layer superficial stuff. I'm going to be
4:01
talking about how to describe that person like they are your best friend
4:05
and know every single little nuance of their behavior, how they think, so you
4:10
can really talk to them in a way that really resonates with them and has a
4:14
huge amount of cut through in today's extremely noisy market.
4:19
So, let's dive into it. Now, the first thing is basically we're going to be
4:23
identifying your dream buyer. Now, this sounds like a cool concept, but what how
4:28
do we actually do that? How do I identify who is that dream buyer for
4:33
your business? Well, your dream buyer can be pretty much identified through
4:37
using Paro's principle, the 8020 rule. Um, you know, basically, if you don't
4:42
know, Paro was an Italian economist who became famous for his 8020 rule. Now,
4:47
this is commonly called the paro principle. You might have heard of it.
4:51
And he first discovered the rule when he found out that 80% of a nation's wealth
4:56
was controlled by 20% of the population. And as he studied this phenomenon like
5:03
more deeply in all different areas, he found that a disproportionate
5:06
relationship between cause and effect in all other areas of life including like
5:11
real estate and growing crops and all sorts of things. Basically he found that
5:16
you know 20% of the inputs creates 80% of the result. 20% of the workers
5:23
produce 80% of the results. 20% of the customers create 80% of the revenue. 20%
5:28
of the roads create you know 80% of the crashes and so on and so forth. Now his
5:34
8020 rule basically held true you know in all areas of business as well
5:39
including like the popularity of products or services that you sell
5:43
sources of your incoming leads whether it's Facebook or Google or what the
5:46
channel might be customer service problems that you get and complaints um
5:51
reasons that your customers buy. you know, out of all the kind of bells and
5:55
whistles and features and benefits, you know, there's kind of 20% of them that
5:59
are going to basically push 80% over the edge in terms of buying. Um, and the big
6:04
one is really the customers that bring in the revenue of profits. So, you know,
6:09
20% of customers in your business will account for 80% of the revenue and
6:15
profits. Now, you might have heard of the 8020 rule, but what most people
6:20
don't know is the the 8020 rule or the parados principle is exponential.
6:26
Meaning that that initial 20% out of the 8020 rule also still applies. So
6:33
basically what that means is that if you take you know the 8020 rule and then you
6:38
basically take that 20% out of the 8020 and you look at what are the top 20%
6:44
from that 20%. It's basically meaning that the top 20% of the top 20% of your
6:49
customers or really when you look at it further and you boil it down, it's
6:53
really the 4% of customers bring in 64% of the revenue and profits for your
6:59
business. So you're basically just using the 8020 rule on the 8020 rule to get to
7:05
that analysis and that's essentially calculated as 80% of you know the 80%
7:12
will kind of give you that 64% and really this is an incredibly
7:17
powerful thing when you think about it. You know 4% of your entire customer base
7:22
will bring in 64% of your revenue. meaning that you can just focus focus
7:27
and kind of laser in on these guys and more importantly find more customers
7:32
like them right now. So, how do you actually do that? Well, if you have like
7:36
an online accounting software, you can export all the customers and it will
7:40
have like the revenue attached to that. And if that's a little bit beyond you,
7:44
meet with your bookkeeper, your accountant or your financial officer,
7:48
your CFO. Or if you don't have any of those, go out and hire one. hire an
7:52
external CFO and get them to come into your business and dig through all the
7:57
numbers for you because this is really the most profound thing ever. Like if
8:01
you know exactly the type of dream buyer that kind of brings in 64% of your
8:07
revenue, you can just go out and find like what are the what are the traits
8:10
that these guys all share? How do I speak to these people specifically? What
8:15
are their demographics? What does that target market look like for me and for
8:19
my business? because then you stop trying to talk to everybody and you talk
8:23
to the buyers, you know, the players with money, the guys that are really
8:27
going to be able to help you um and kind of help you grow your business and
8:31
propel your business forward and the people that you can serve the most as
8:35
well because the chances are if they're bringing in the most revenue and profits
8:39
that they're the ones that are getting the most value from your business as
8:43
well. Now, the reason that I say revenue and profits and not just profits is
8:48
because it depends on what kind of business that you're in. Like, you might
8:51
find that after you do this analysis on your business that like there's like two
8:55
or three customers that bring in the bulk of of profit for your business. And
9:00
if that's the case, then those people are few and far between. And you might
9:04
not be able to kind of go out there and reach those people with ease. Like it
9:08
might be quite difficult or, you know, using marketing to get them. They might
9:13
have been with you for a couple of years and it's taken you six to 12 months just
9:16
to get one of those types of customers. So really you want to look at the
9:21
relationship between the revenue and also at the profits and and kind of see
9:26
like is there going to be enough for me to really go out there um you know and
9:30
make decisions based on just these two or three customers like are there really
9:34
any similarities around them and probably the case will be no at that
9:38
small level. So that's the reason that I say, you know, look at both the revenue
9:42
terms of overall gross sales volume and also at the profits.
9:48
So now once you've kind of identified who they are and you want to kind of
9:52
start looking at those demographics and really identify who they are, where
9:56
they're located, how old they are, what gender, there is a gender skew amongst
10:01
them and really start to kind of find out exactly who are these people. Right
10:06
now, for this example, I'm just going to say that I'm a property investment
10:10
business, right? And our target market is going to be 30 to 55 year old working
10:15
professionals in a highpaying corporate job. Now, I've never done this research
10:19
before. I'm going to literally just be going on the fly and having it just so
10:24
you were like in the room with me looking over my shoulder and you owned a
10:27
property investment business and we were going to start doing this process for
10:31
your business. So, I'm going to really try to leave no stone unturned and go
10:35
through my entire process step by step. So, it will be a long training, but I
10:40
assure you this is going to be one of the most powerful and profound things
10:44
that you ever do in your business if you follow this step by step.
10:49
So, we'll say that like, you know, I I help people quit their 9 to5 and replace
10:53
their income through property investment. That's kind of sums up like
10:57
what we're what we're going to be doing, who we kind of how we help people and
11:02
what our overall value proposition is to the marketplace.
11:06
So, basically, this kind of brings us to the Halo strategy. And I've got a doc
11:10
that you can kind of get in in the the files for this module that you can go
11:14
and click and download. It's a Google doc sheet or you can get it as an Excel.
11:18
And it basically is a sheet that we're going to be running you through today
11:22
that shows you exactly, you know, we're going to be filling out all of these
11:26
different steps along the way for the Halo strategy to really uncover all of
11:30
the kind of the deepest hopes and fears, pains and dreams, and all the really
11:35
deep desires of your marketplace and what I call the primal desires of your
11:41
marketplace. and you know what kind of language that they use and what are some
11:45
unexpected insights that we can find and we're going to be documenting and
11:49
putting this all in through to the Halo strategy document sheet and this thing
11:53
is going to be one of the most valuable resources for your entire business.
11:58
Okay, so that's going to basically we're going
12:02
to do I'll open up that document in a moment and we're going to go through the
12:04
whole process but let's just have a look at what this looks at step by step. So
12:08
that's really diving inside the monkey brain. Like what questions are your your
12:13
your market asking? Like how do you actually know exactly what it is that
12:18
your market wants? What are they thinking about? What are they constantly
12:22
asking all of the time? And that's really what I'm going to be diving into
12:26
right now and showing you how to find those out like without doing cumbersome
12:31
market research in terms of buying market research reports or you know
12:36
doing firthand market research and asking thousands of people. How do we
12:41
actually just know without a shadow of a doubt the questions that our market is
12:45
asking and what are their biggest hair on fire problems that they're looking to
12:50
solve? Right now, due to technology, I'm about to show you a little hack that I
12:54
use that's going to show us all of that and a lot more. So, basically what I'll
12:58
do is I'll fire up this and we'll go into it right now. All right. So, here
13:02
we are on Google. Now, the first place that I start like to start is a website
13:06
called answer the public. And basically what this website is, it gets all the
13:13
aggregate data of questions that people are asking on both Google and Bing and
13:19
shows us all the questions like direct person to keyboard, all the things that
13:24
they're like the the questions that are keeping them up at night, all their
13:28
concerns, the things that they want to know more about. And if you come in here
13:31
for instance and type in property investment and
13:36
click on this it will then basically as of you know this date when it's got the
13:42
data last it will basically pull up all of the questions that people are having
13:48
in this sexy looking graph. Right? It's pretty hard to read off this gra graph
13:53
though. Um so what you want to do is click over here on data. Um and these
13:59
are all the things all the questions I have. Can property investment make you
14:04
rich? Um how property investment works? Are property investment courses
14:08
taxdeductible? Um what what investment property
14:12
expenses are taxdeductible? Investment property where to start in property
14:16
investment. It's got different years to select from. Then you scroll down here.
14:22
Um here we've got some more. Another one. Let's click on this property
14:27
investment good or bad property investment for beginners u property in
14:32
investment property can you live in it there's a whole bunch of questions so
14:36
you don't want to start with Google with just a blank canvas and wonder like how
14:39
to start researching your your market you want to have a look and see already
14:44
what are the biggest and most common questions that are coming up right now
14:48
is basically we're going to say that we're a property investment company that
14:52
helps people you know retire they are quit their 9 to5 and that's all because
14:57
the end outcome that they're trying to get to in a place where they would want
15:01
to be rich right where they would be financially set up that's the reason
15:05
that they're going to be going through this whole process of investing in pro
15:09
in property so then I'll just take this one randomly um and before we we we
15:16
actually start doing Google and we start digging around let me run you through
15:19
this worksheet which is the Halo strategy template worksheet right So,
15:24
this is in the resource section of this video, and you can basically go in there
15:28
and click and make your own copy of this by clicking here and then going make a
15:33
copy. Okay? And this is where you're going to start populating this data in.
15:38
And you can see here, we're going to be researching our markets hopes and
15:42
dreams, their pains and fears, their barriers and uncertainties, and we're
15:47
also going to be highlighting any unexpected insights that we did not
15:50
expect. Um, and also like the vernacular, the glossery of verbiage,
15:55
jargon, and niche specific terms or language that people use in this market,
16:01
like acronyms and all that kind of stuff. We're going to be collecting
16:04
those as well. So, we can basically include elements of those depending on
16:10
what segment of the market that we're that we're targeting. And when I say
16:13
segment of the market, here we've got newbie, intimate, and advanced. So, you
16:18
know, for you, you're going to have to get clear on who it is specifically that
16:22
you want to help, where you're going to have the best conversion rate, which
16:25
clients are going to bring you the highest lifetime value, and and just
16:28
what you're passionate about, and really where you feel your expertise is best
16:32
positioned to help what area of the market. Then, we've got the source,
16:37
which is we can just put the link in there so we can reference it in the
16:40
future. And then any other miscellaneous notes. Let me just clear this formatting
16:45
um on here. Cool. So then basically we'll go back
16:50
here, get this term, property investment make you rich, right? So we might just
16:54
type this in and then type in forums, right? Forums are just a phenomenal
16:59
phenomenal resource because you can go into these forums and it's like, you
17:05
know, being a fly on the wall and and and listening to thousands of
17:09
conversations that your marketplace is having behind closed doors on the
17:15
internet where sometime they're obviously more often than not using not
17:19
using their real name. So they share a lot of stuff that they wouldn't if you
17:24
interviewed customers, right? um or if you ask friends or anything like that
17:28
like the forums are a really really great place to start. So what you want
17:34
to do is type in you know property invest can property investment make you
17:38
rich um forums and then we just want to start seeing
17:43
what we've got. We want to open up a few and see if there's anything on here that
17:47
looks good. Um, and we'll have a look at that one as
17:53
well and just see what we find. Now, you know, by going through this process,
17:59
you're going to see that there is going to be, you know, it's quite a process.
18:05
We're we're not going to leave any stone unturned. And that means, you know, this
18:09
isn't something like, oh, let me just spend an hour and get this over and done
18:12
with. No, like this is something that you should spend a week on. Like there
18:16
isn't anything that is more important than really like putting together
18:22
breakthrough marketing than understanding your marketplace.
18:26
Understanding what is the absolute bullseye of that marketplace that just
18:31
sets that prospect on fire. So when you write copy, when you write ads, when you
18:37
build landing pages and write emails, you know, your words, they strike like
18:42
lightning because it's like you're speaking directly to your prospect
18:46
because you know everything about them. And this is like no one does this stuff,
18:52
right? Even all the A-level copywriters that I know, they always assume that
18:57
they know the market and they don't actually take the time to do this. And
19:01
this this is really one of my secret weapons that has allowed me to just go
19:05
into markets and just invade and conquer and just beat the pants off my
19:10
competition because I know that market more intimately than any of my
19:15
competitors. So, you know, just going into this process, you're going to see
19:18
that it is a lengthy process, but it is incredibly empowerful. It was so so
19:23
powerful. I just really don't want you to underestimate the importance of this
19:27
element because, you know, it's not the sexiest thing, but I can tell you, you
19:31
know, when you see the results, that's going to be the sexiest thing. So, let
19:35
me just go in and see what we can find here. Now, we're not looking just to
19:38
read like this is like which investment will make you rich. And this is
19:41
obviously some blog post. We're not really overly concerned with the actual
19:45
content of this, even though you do want to know what people are talking about in
19:49
your market. The thing also more that you want to know is like what are the
19:54
comments and there's no comments on this one so I'm going to quickly get out of
19:57
that. Um, next one is this one. Good day all. First time poster longtime lurker.
20:04
As a 21-year-old with little official investment financial education, the
20:09
financial world seems like a bloody complicated mess. Turning 21 and
20:13
studying fourth year project management and working full-time Melbourne,
20:16
Australia. 50K in HEX. 50k in bank earnings. Um 10k in super. 55k perom
20:23
income in 2019. I'm seeking somewhere to start looking at researching and putting
20:26
in the work. Um let's see if this is too early on or there's anything good in
20:31
here. So don't put it in the stock market or
20:44
banks. Okay. So this is in pretty interesting. Um, so people are
20:50
comparing the property investment market to the
20:54
stock market or even a bank. So let me come in here. I will put that in
20:59
unexpected insights. I did not expect that to be the case, but it is. So let's
21:05
just put that in there. And you just want to put something like
21:13
comparing property investment
21:18
with stock market and or banks. Cool. So, let's go back
21:26
in. Um, overrated book in my opinion. D.
21:33
Yes. D. My son's 21. 65K. So, this is a lot of people giving
21:38
advice to somebody that may be too too young for our market, but this looks
21:42
like it's a know this Whirlpool's got a bunch of good stuff on here. So, what I
21:47
probably want to do is click on forums and then just come and look for a search
21:51
bar here and type in property investment.
21:58
Um, let me just chuck in rich as well. Oh, here.
22:03
and then put rich in here just to see the triggers anything based on my
22:08
question of make you rich. Right. So what do we have here?
22:16
So there's a bunch of forums going on here.
22:22
Investing in property your success. Let's open up this one in a new tab. Um
22:26
books for beginners. That looks cool as well. Learning the basics of investing
22:31
in property. Yep. We'll have a look at that too.
22:36
And what else? First investment property advice. So where, you know, this is the
22:44
first little point that we're starting with is this forum because we've found
22:47
found some good stuff. So let's have a look and see what we can find.
22:52
I went through a very interesting lecture last night on property
22:54
investment by the rich dad series of seminars. Okay, so this looks like
23:01
we'll just grab this and we might go down this further. What do we got here?
23:06
Miscellaneous notes. I'll just put that on here because I'm sure if we type in
23:10
this. Here we go. Right. Upcoming for real
23:14
estate workshop. Rich education. There's obviously a book on it.
23:22
Um, cool. So, I'm just going to take this
23:29
and put this here. Sorry, this wasn't the one I clicked on.
23:35
What's this one here? And again, I want to know, guys. I want
23:40
to know like what my market is reading, where they're getting their information
23:44
about um you know, who are those authors and and what are the comments on on
23:49
those books, which we'll which we'll dive into a little bit later on. But
23:52
cool, this looks good. I'll save this. Put this in a source as well. I can
23:56
reference that later when I get around to it. Format that up. Otherwise, it's
24:01
going to do my head in. Cool. Let's jump back into it.
24:13
Nothing there. To get the ball rolling, you need to work out a way to save at
24:18
least 20% deposit plus stamp duty legal fees to purchase a
24:24
property that you want. Okay, cool. Let's put this in here. So,
24:28
this is a barrier. So, I'll just paste that here first. Get the formatting
24:34
there. Awesome. Let's put that in here. And then I said 20% to keep things under
24:42
control. I would not be taking out a loan for the deposit to save up this
24:45
initial deposit to somehow concentrate on putting some funds away for your
24:48
existing income stream. Yes, it's possible to purchase a property that can
24:52
be valued much differently even the same day that you purchase.
24:57
Um, so these guys look like they're talking
25:00
about specifically this one lecturer. So I'm going to close
25:05
this and see what else we can find. Too young again. Someone's just finished
25:11
school. Can someone please point me in the right
25:16
direction? I am complete novice beginner. no idea what or how I can use
25:20
the equity in my house and what first steps are to using equity and money to
25:25
purchase my first rental property and then using the equity to buy another and
25:29
so on. Any YouTube videos for Australia u Australia for dummies can watch.
25:37
All right, so first one here capital gain. Um, this looks like a term to go
25:45
into here. And then what you typically want
25:48
to do is just jump on here and just type in meaning. Even if you feel like you
25:52
know the meaning, the best thing is to just get it from here and then plug it
25:56
straight in. Um, a profit from the sale of a property or investment. Again, need
26:02
to start understanding, you know, the vernacular that people are using in this
26:05
market. Um, positive geared properties. Here's
26:10
another one. I'll put in property meaning
26:19
positive occurs when you're re you receive more in rental income from your
26:23
tenants than what you pay on the likes of loans repayments interest. Awesome.
26:28
Okay. So, we'll stick this one in here and we'll get this
26:38
Awesome. It's got two different terms there
26:55
already. I don't understand positive gear. Want
27:00
to create a rental portfolio. All right.
27:06
So, this is a want. Someone wants to create a rental portfolio.
27:12
So, we'll put this in the hopes and dreams. And we've got our few our first
27:18
thing to in terms of one of our hopes and dreams or something that they're
27:21
that our market's looking to achieve. And we're going to keep building this
27:25
thing out. And you're going to see by the end of this process that you are
27:29
really going to understand your market more so than anybody because no one's
27:34
willing to do this work. No one's willing to roll up their sleeves and get
27:38
in the trenches and dig through forums for hours, if not days, to find out
27:44
exactly what this market wants, right? Um, go to your bank, speak to a home
27:49
loan lender, and you just want to start scanning and seeing if anything pops out
27:54
at you that you can kind of put into your research sheet.
27:58
Um, go to Somersoft forums and read, read, read. You'll soon realize it's
28:02
easy path to riches. Um, all right. It's another thing that they
28:09
want. Sorry. They want an easy path to riches,
28:17
doesn't everybody? So, let's just stick this guy in here.
28:22
I don't know what the formatting does this, so I'm just going to make it all
28:25
white. Awesome. Let's jump back in.
28:33
They're just saying it's you'll you'll not, but that's what they want. So,
28:36
that's why I've pasted that in there. That said, there's plenty who have made
28:39
it um on those forums, even those who didn't simply ride the booms.
28:45
This is so true. It's hard to beat the market by following the herd.
28:50
Imagine. Okay, this is an interesting one. It's hard to beat the market by
28:54
following the herd. Imagine if everyone had the idea to own two homes. Um, who'd
28:59
be paying the rent? The ship has sailed. Okay. So,
29:06
I'm going to put this thing in as a barrier
29:12
because this is something that they're saying is a barrier that it's like if
29:17
everybody's doing this then h how can it work for them, right?
29:25
Simply writing booms. They seem to be the types who live through knowing every
29:29
cell in every suburb they look at. They can pounce on a bargain immediately. I'd
29:33
be very surprised if they buy and hold strategies.
29:39
All right, look at this. Okay. Um, positive gears pays for itself and all
29:44
fees. Yep. So, that's what we've got. Um, which do we have over here in terms
29:49
of ver venacular? So, we got capital game and positive gear properties. But
29:53
now what we're seeing here is that this person has got negative and look they've
29:58
even got the the meaning for us which is awesome. So what we'll do here like on
30:04
the other ones we will come in and we will cost you money.
30:10
So again we can use theirs but no we're going to we're not going to rely on
30:15
them. We're going to go and we're going to get our own one. And let's type in
30:20
meaning. Negative gear is a form of leverage whereby investors borrow money
30:25
to acquire an income producing managing investment including
30:33
depreciation. Okay, cool. So, we'll get this
30:37
come back, paste it in here, get the formatting going. Bang. And then
30:46
there was another one on here as well. Neutral gear pays for itself and
30:49
expenses. That one seems pretty straightforward. We can just type that
30:52
straight in there. So there.
31:04
And again, most people they really feel like that they know all this stuff and
31:09
that they don't need to do it. Um but from my experience from working with
31:14
thousands of clients is that even the most seasoned seasoned um you know
31:22
founders don't know the market like they really think that they know the market.
31:27
Um and and the way that I know that is by doing this research in in multiple
31:31
different markets to really find out what that market wants. Um
31:37
so we're still going to be scanning here. What is your overall risk profile
31:41
and strategy? How often would that make that happen?
31:46
How on earth a person to get positive gear property these days? For example,
31:50
some easy not okay. What is this change use?
31:56
Not easy but impossible and depending on location
32:00
positive geared. So these forums go on and on and on, right? So we might even
32:05
want to come in here. Um, losing money isn't a way to get
32:10
rich. Okay, so here we go. This is our first fear.
32:17
Um, pains and fears, losing money. Um, and look, this one, like I've got it
32:24
down here and said that I'm going to make all of this white again so it
32:27
doesn't do that to me again. So, the losing money, this is obviously
32:33
a fear understandably. And I've put this on the newbie, but this is going to be
32:37
across the board, right? So, we're going to get that across the board and say
32:42
that everybody in this market, you know, that's something that they want to avoid
32:46
naturally. Let's see what else we've got here.
32:50
Research best way to avoid losing it all on research, the best way to Okay,
32:54
because this comment's got some good stuff.
33:01
Anything else on here? Um, but if you're determined to read something, the
33:04
National Bureau of Statistics probably your most helpful thing. Research where
33:08
you'd want to buy. Um, unemployment rates. So, this keeps on coming up,
33:14
where to buy, right? So, this this is definitely is like a question and like
33:20
just a miscellaneous notes is like where to buy. Um, it seems like
33:27
everybody wants to know that just like everyone's talking about suburbs,
33:31
everyone's talking about like, oh, you need to look at these statistics and
33:34
find out where to buy. So, that's obviously a big big takeaway as well.
33:38
And let's see anything else on here. Okay, so here it does not make out
33:47
property investment to be a getri scheme as some books do. So this is obviously
33:53
another thing um that people are concerned with. So let's put it in here.
34:04
And obviously the people that are in the intermediate advance, they would
34:07
probably understand that it's not a get-richque get-rich quick scheme. So I
34:12
haven't put it in those one. Um I've put it in the newbie market. And this is
34:15
also a barrier and uncertainty for that market as well.
34:22
And then what we'll do is so that that search got us a few goodies. Let's look
34:27
at wealth. Um offer a wealth of information. Let's look what else we've
34:31
got here. Did you buy more wealth from residential
34:35
property or building wealth through property investment?
34:42
And look, I'm going to take this one. Building wealth through property
34:45
investment because that's what these people want, right? That's that's what
34:49
they're all looking to do. Um, so again, we'll put that in there. Building wealth
34:54
through property investment over time would eventually become
35:00
positive gear. House to rents up. So, this is one place, okay, that I look.
35:04
I'm not going to go through and spend the full day or two days on this and
35:10
make you watch it all like I would do, but this is definitely I just done a
35:14
search for forums on Google and that's how we found this. Right? So, you want
35:18
to start going through and selecting any keywords on here and how it works and
35:22
really start to do your own research, go under forums. Now, another great place
35:27
after we've done the forums that we want to go to that I like going to is the the
35:32
biggest question platform in the world, which is Kora.
35:36
And this is just literally a platform where people go and just put their
35:41
questions and other people come in and answer them. So, we'll come on to this
35:44
one and type in property investment
35:50
and let's see what we can find. Can I make 30 million in under three
36:00
years flipping houses? Is rental property investment the most efficient
36:04
way to build wealth? This definitely looks like it's on track to where we
36:09
want to be and what we want to be doing. Okay. I've been renting out rentals
36:14
since I was 22 years old. That is almost 48 years. I was never in a rush and
36:18
always took my time, but I looked at real estate on almost daily basis. I
36:22
work with a realtor and a mortgage ver blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
36:25
Let's just have a look and see if we can find anything here.
36:29
Rental property like any other has to be purchased at the right price. All right,
36:38
this is a barrier. So, we're going to put this in the
36:42
barrier. And this is going to be for all the different markets.
36:49
Sorry, let's come back here. It's usually leverage, i.e. purchased
36:55
with a mortgage, special features, a rental property that is purchased,
36:59
right? Rental income be sufficient to cover most expenses. Um therefore rental
37:04
property can negative cash flow which we know to a sizable positive cash flow and
37:09
it will probably go up in value of course. Disadvantage of rental property
37:13
is that it takes time to manage. Okay. So we don't know if this is going to be
37:19
the case for us. So I'm not going to stick that in just there. Leverage get
37:23
the most real estate investors even realize. Okay. This is a quite lengthy
37:26
comment. All right.
37:36
If you want to become less dependent on stockbased investment. So this is Oh, so
37:43
that's an ad. Don't want to click on that. Most efficient. Interesting how
37:46
you phrase that in a nutshell. Um I don't that there are any absolutes in
37:50
wealth building. Um too many variables and too many diversified skill sets. If
37:55
you're a talented tech guy, make the internet bend your to your will like the
37:59
Matrix, then do that. Um, if you have some basic financial skills, some basic
38:03
handyman skills, and skill to learn and improve, the rental market might be for
38:08
you. I can tell you when I went from
38:14
basically broke to owning seven figures of property in about four years. All
38:19
right, I like that. Um, so
38:25
I'm just I I like it. I don't know why I like it yet. Um, so I'm just going to
38:30
put that in the miscellaneous notes up here. Um, and again, I can come back to
38:33
that. That might be an idea for, you know, a headline or whatever it might
38:38
be. But when you find things that jump out at you like that, you definitely
38:42
want to keep them um so you can further reference them later down the line.
38:51
There is some debt there for sure, but plenty of equity. Reflect on my personal
38:54
balance sheet. Um, these are fading a little research of units vacant
38:59
reading in between the lines. Usually, someone wants rentals, but for whatever
39:02
reason there's some serious doubts about whether or not it's for you. Sorry, I'm
39:06
not sorry for saying this, but you aren't going to find that answer on the
39:10
internet. I beg to differ. Um, no, you used the word efficient.
39:19
So, again, this is a some long stuff on here. So again, what
39:25
I want to do maybe search for wealth. Rental properties can be fantastic ways
39:40
to build wealth. So that's obviously what they want to do
39:44
is build wealth, get some tenants, and get rich. Let's
39:52
look at this. um that's what they want. So, let's
39:56
stick it in here. And that's what the inter intermediate market will want as
40:00
well. So, we'll stick it in here. And we'll also stick it in here.
40:06
All right. Sorry, we're back to the wrong one.
40:13
And you can see here there's 28 instances of wealth. So, I like to just
40:16
scan through and see if there's anything that's going to jump out. I believe so.
40:20
Statistics show that real estate in general is the most effective way to
40:24
build wealth. Awesome. Let's get this
40:30
um and we'll just put this in the
40:36
miscellaneous notes as well. Awesome. And I know it says the US, but
40:41
we can see that corresponds to the Australian market or whatever whatever
40:45
you know market that you're that you're operating in.
40:52
Rentals are not fast path out but certainly on there. Awesome. Let's say
40:56
rich. Is there anyone searching for rich? What is the most effective yet
40:59
efficient way to get rich? That's another forum. How to get rich
41:02
investing. Let's open up that one. And I think
41:12
Okay, let's see what we've got here. Oh, sorry. This is I've clicked on the
41:17
wrong thing here and here. Um,
41:25
so what we're going to do is this is just one forum. Let's go back to this
41:28
one and see if there's any other strings on here.
41:36
This is people talking about Airbnb. What types of rental properties generate
41:40
the most income? These are all great questions.
41:44
Going to come in here and just try to refine
41:56
this a little bit down. We'll open up these two and let's see
42:06
what we find. What are the only books you read
42:11
properly? Investment mentally. All right, so Rich Dad, poor dad. We are
42:18
going to stick this. Oh, we've already got that. Awesome. We're ahead of the
42:21
game on that one. Comprehensive library.
42:30
Wonderful. Here we go. and now we can obviously go out and we
42:36
can have a look at those further down the line as well.
42:42
There are all the books. All right, enough of that.
42:54
Is multiple leverage property investment the best option for serious wealth
42:57
creation for the average income earner? Investing with borrowed money is a
43:05
double-edged sword. This strategy works as long as property values are
43:08
increasing and your bank doesn't call for the loan is decline. Keep in mind
43:11
the same strategy um for the famous dam Dave Ramsey was using when his bank gave
43:17
him 90 days to come up with $1.2 million worth of short loans. Anything on here?
43:24
No, nothing else on here. Right. So, you can keep digging. core is another
43:29
fantastic resource to go to. Then another one that I like to look at is
43:34
Reddit. And Reddit again is is a gold mine, an
43:41
absolute gold mine. So, we want to come on here, property investment,
43:48
and let's see what we can find here. Resources for buying an investment
43:51
property. Um, costs of investment property. What am I missing? Is now a
43:56
good time to buy an investment property? Let's open that one. Purchasing an
44:00
investment property with my siblings. Paying off an investment property in a
44:04
city. Investment property tax questions. How to reinvest
44:09
mortgage from investment property. First investment property. Let's have a
44:14
look at this one as well. So, what you can see is here is also the
44:19
comments. And you want to certainly look at, you know, ones that do have, you
44:24
know, a bunch of activity and a bunch of comments on them because they're the
44:27
ones that you're going to get, you know, some gold from. Um, is now a good time
44:30
to buy an investment property? So, first of all, this right here
44:37
is a barrier, right? This is a question that someone's got. This is a question
44:41
someone's asking. Is now a good time to buy a property investment? So the if if
44:45
now is not the right time or that is a question that's going to be coming up to
44:48
someone's head, that is certainly going to be a barrier, right? And I would even
44:53
put that onto the intermediate market as well is knowing whether or not it's
44:57
going to be the right time. So let's get back to it. So my wife and I have just
45:01
recently had to move in with my mother-in-law to help while she had some
45:04
prolonged surgeries. We initially moved to six months. My wife and I have agreed
45:08
to stay. My wife and I um now find ourselves in a situation. We have close
45:12
to 50k in spare cash. So this is a few times that we've seen this right where
45:18
people have a bunch of money saved up and after their bills and entertaining
45:22
and da we have no debts as we used to six month period to pay off all the
45:27
debt. Now we have about 10k in savings and obviously we'll be adding close to
45:30
1k per week. So the thing that keeps on coming up is people they've got like
45:35
spare cash right and it's kind of just sitting there rotting. It's not really
45:39
doing anything. Again, I'm just going to put that um
45:46
cuz I can call that out. Would now be a good time to buy in. What
45:54
would be my wife's money? I put in 50k and bought a property of 300k.
46:04
Right. Not much here. I have 10,000 save for my first rental
46:09
property again. Right. People saving up money. I guess the advice I'm asking is,
46:13
should I wait until I save more? All of the lenders I've spoken to say I need
46:18
down rental property. Is there any something better that I can use money?
46:22
Credit card debts. You want to get rid of all that that
46:27
debt first. In my opinion, hopefully emergency fund aside for your money
46:30
investing. That is what I was thinking. You need to slow your roll. Getting a
46:34
real estate portfolio is not automatic. There will be significant upfront costs.
46:40
Okay, here we go. Again, this is going to be a barrier for
46:50
the newbie market. Um, but it's also a fear, right? There's going to be a fear
46:55
that there's going to be significant upfront costs here. Now, let's else what
46:59
we've got. Um, not guaranteed tenant income every
47:06
month. Okay, this is another fear. We're going to put that across all of
47:13
them. Maybe not the advanced market. Sorry. So, we'll leave that one out for
47:16
there. It can pay off in the long run, but you
47:22
have to survive the short run. And if you're still carrying credit card debt,
47:26
it doesn't sound like you are in a position to do that.
47:34
All right. So again, we're we're getting now what
47:39
we also want to do is we're getting very specific property stuff. So let's just
47:43
think about what is the bigger arm on that, right? And the bigger arm here is
47:48
just investing in general, right? Um and people building wealth through investing
47:53
and what we've seen is that people are investing in in you know shares and
47:57
stocks and all that kind of stuff. And property is just one way to do that. So
48:00
let's let's kind of zoom out even further and have a look what is the
48:04
bigger umbrella under investing that people are talking about. And we might
48:09
type in best investment vehicle.
48:21
Best investment. And let's put property in there just to see if we get anything
48:25
skewed towards that. This one looks cool. Um, best way to get
48:32
into real estate investing and how to find the properties and actually get
48:35
money to invest. Um, now I know that there is a way to get money without
48:39
actually having using debt. Please someone help me get into this. Don't
48:43
believe the hype. All of these investing workshops
48:46
um are hard money lenders just trying to sell you on a loan.
48:53
All right, this is a fear. Um, so we're going to put this in here.
48:59
It's a fear of this market for the newbies.
49:04
Um, fix and flip. Every market is full of professionals already doing this.
49:08
Plus, how's marketing doing? Well, lots of talk in a recession. I'm a big
49:11
believer of buy and hold in the economy. All right. Not a great dot there.
49:19
Best investment vehicle to save side money in a taxefficient way. Currently,
49:23
I'm 22 year old male and I make 80,000 at my full-time job. I have 401k my
49:28
employer which should max out. Yeah. So, obviously 401k this is American data.
49:32
It's still we still want to find out and see that there's going to be anything on
49:35
here. Otherwise, you'll get to space bay.
49:39
Absolutely. Which I made cut down. All right. So,
49:46
we'll just go back into investing.
49:55
Investing for beginners. Let's have a look and see if there's anything on
49:58
here. Um, I've been sent tons of advers apps in Acorn designed to get people
50:02
started on investing. And whilst I don't usually take it advertising commercials,
50:07
let's see in here there's anything property.
50:14
Well, this one looks like it's got a bit of activity going on.
50:22
So, the other thing that they want to do is what we're seeing a lot is obviously
50:27
saving money is something that they want to do. Um,
50:32
and I saw offset tax in here. So, we'll put that under there as well.
50:40
And so, like so far, you know, we've used forums, we've used Kora, and we've
50:46
we've used Reddit. Now, the other thing that we want to also dive into is
50:51
YouTube comments, right? So, we'll come over to YouTube
50:56
here for a moment. and type in
51:09
property investment for wealth and let's just have a little look or we
51:14
can just go straight through to Google and search on there as well. I mean on
51:18
YouTube this one here. Let's type in
51:25
Hey everyone, it's Michael Baris back again.
51:29
So we can find perfect. All right.
51:34
Create passive income. All right. Here's a dream.
51:44
This is something that they want to do. So this is a really good one. And that's
51:48
across the market all over them. And so you're beginning to see right that as we
51:53
go through this process what we're finding. So, it's not so much more about
51:56
the content on this that we're looking at. What we want to go do, okay, there's
52:00
no not really anything on here. Um, in terms of comments, the comment sections
52:04
is usually a fantastic place to start, but these people haven't enabled
52:09
comments. Um, all right, here's another thing. Real
52:19
estate investing with no money. This is obviously and this is the same author
52:24
Robert Kiyosaki who came up before. Um, so that's for the beginner market is
52:30
definitely what they want. Let's come back to YouTube.
52:36
Is it see there's any comments on here? Yes. Okay, perfect.
52:41
Um, I hear keeping use OPM. Okay, what's
52:49
OPM? I keep hearing use OPM yet I don't hear define investors so I can use
52:54
there. So we'll type in this OPM meaning office of personal management
53:07
OPM property investment
53:13
meaning see if we can find anything on this
53:18
other people's money. Okay. So again, we want to come down here, type in OPM,
53:32
and put that there. Um, which is what it stands for. Let's get back to it.
53:45
What do we got? I've been retail for 20 years. In the past 3 years, I've been
53:48
using Opio to flip to buy and flip properties at a profit. They get 6% on
53:52
their money in about 3 months. I get the profit off the flip. Robert Kiyosaki is
53:56
right. It works magically. I'm working I'm looking forward to learning how to
54:00
use OPM when buying rentals. I see negative comments on this post as they
54:04
are obviously not educated, not willing to open their mind.
54:10
So again, you want to start looking through all of these YouTube videos and
54:16
seeing what everyone's saying, right? Okay, here's another one. Long-term
54:30
long-term net worth growth. This is what they
54:34
want. And I'm going to say for this one like yeah the intermediates will the
54:40
newbies will want it. The definitely the intermediates are going to want it
54:44
actually. Who am I falling? Everyone's going to want it. Um so we'll put that
54:48
one in here. So even looking at the t even looking at the titles can be a
54:52
great place right um to start. So let's look at some of these comments.
54:58
So it's another this is a book. Um, so let's see if we've already got it in
55:05
our list. Yep, we've already got it. The millionaire real estate investor. Um,
55:09
which is you're starting to see things pop up, right, from multiple different
55:13
areas. Um, which is a good sign. It means that we're really starting to pull
55:18
out these strings and find out all this other research on here.
55:22
Um, let's see if there's anything else on
55:27
here. And again, so like I'll just close a
55:33
bunch of these different tabs in here because we've dug through a bunch of
55:36
these. Um, but this is one that we didn't we didn't go into. So, property
55:41
chat.com.au. Why property investing sucks for
55:46
becoming rich. Um, so this is someone that's obviously posting the negative
55:49
angle. Um, and look, we could go through and read this. Um, let's see what some
55:55
of the comments are saying. I agree. Making money in business. Hold
56:01
it in real estate. Gold and silver. You can make money in real estate. Um
56:06
through time. Yeah. To timing. You invest in time and creating equity
56:10
through developing, renovating. Aha. This is a good one. Waiting 20
56:18
years to retire from property. Um so this is obviously a fear is that it's
56:24
going to take long, right? And that's also going to be a barrier across all of
56:29
those is that how long is this thing going to take? Do you know what I mean?
56:32
And that's definitely going to be a pain and a fear is just the whole thing about
56:38
waiting. I'm going to put that more so for the beginning or even into the
56:41
intermediate markets. They maybe invest in one or two properties and they're not
56:44
really seeing the gains that they want from this. Um, so let's go back to this.
56:53
Cool. The words retire on property do not make sense. Um, all right. This one
56:58
is obviously very negative. So, let's go and find something that's a little bit
57:04
and look at this. Right. So, you can see that in here there's like under this one
57:09
that there's 3,336 other forums or sub forums and then
57:14
there's 116,000 comments. So, you can really start to understand like that you
57:21
can spend a lot of time doing this. So with this again, where to buy, where to
57:25
find IPS, which is obviously investment properties, which suburbs are booming,
57:30
um which suburbs think are going to boom, where to find positive cash flow.
57:34
This is all awesome stuff. These are all questions that this market has. So
57:40
we'll come over here and these are going to be under the barriers and
57:44
uncertainties and you're going to start filling this out. This will be for all
57:49
of them. Um, we'll just keep them all in the all on
57:58
the same one now just to keep it nice and simple. Um, and again for this this
58:03
is going to be something that questions in all the different markets that we can
58:07
really lean from. So even sometimes just the forum titles
58:11
is great because these are things that you know like just the these
58:14
descriptions of the forums telling you um the state of property influences in
58:18
the property market investment strategy discussions about the overall strategy
58:22
in cash flow versus capital growth. Again these are both going to be great
58:26
terms that we can add adding value gearing levels debt reduction
58:30
reinvesting buy and hold flipping when to sell. This is all like we can
58:35
literally just get this um
58:42
this whole comment here and stick that guy in there. Um and leave
58:50
that in there and we can go and format that format that up all later. Um where
58:54
to buy I would we want to click into this property investment economics
58:58
investor sor and showcases management the buying and selling process. look,
59:03
negotiating a deal, report with agents, all of this stuff, right? Then you can
59:07
come into here and you might just be operating in
59:11
Melbourne or just in Brisbane and then you can find out all the specific things
59:15
that this market is saying about those. So, I'm not going to go through every
59:19
single thread on here. Um, the last place that we will go to today on this
59:26
will be Amazon, right? So, let's go to Amazon
59:31
and we have got our list of books. So, the first one was Rich Dad, Poor Dad.
59:40
And then we'll come here. It's got 9,000 reviews.
59:45
So then from this, we're going to come in here and we're going to start reading
59:50
those reviews, right? And we want to know like what the one star people are
59:55
saying. We want to know what the the five-star people are saying. But the
59:58
area that I really like to focus on the most is like typically this five star is
1:00:03
going to be all the positive stuff. You definitely do want to read that, but the
1:00:06
three star, right? This is people that are typically put in more thought and
1:00:09
you want to look for the longer comments. The longer the comments, the
1:00:12
more thought has typically gone into it. Um, so let's just see what some of these
1:00:16
people are saying. A very motivational book with a lot of practical steps to
1:00:19
magically achieve the goals listed. Some inaccurate information such as Charles
1:00:23
Schwab dying um penniless. more important is the author um filed for
1:00:28
bankruptcy in 2012. Why is that? D. Some people love this guy, others not so
1:00:33
much. And what we're looking for is anything
1:00:38
that's just going to jump out at us. There are lots of people who love this
1:00:42
book and lots of people who don't. I agree with everything that the author
1:00:44
says. He often brags about his financial IQ the way that Donald Trump brags about
1:00:48
his overall brilliance. By the way, lots of references to Trump um business
1:00:52
genius in the book. Beware I took this book is gross assets or mind your own
1:00:58
business. To me it makes it great book if you're new to real estate and
1:01:02
handling your finances. Let's go to the five stars.
1:01:11
I had I read this book. I had no money. Follow the advice of book and now I have
1:01:14
15 rental properties paid off free and clear my assets. Okay. So,
1:01:23
some of the things that they want is rental properties. So, we'll go in here.
1:01:28
Um, and we've got a way to create rental
1:01:32
portfolios. Um, and we'll just put in here multiple rental properties is what
1:01:38
these people want. Um, these people already probably have them, so we won't
1:01:43
add it on that one. Paid off. Free and clear. my assets more
1:01:50
than cover all of my expenses. Um, so that's another one.
1:01:56
Assets covering expenses is another thing that they want.
1:02:04
And that's from positive cash flow. I add hazard gas.
1:02:08
So that more than cover all my expenses. Awesome.
1:02:18
Let's see here. We were poor dads and we are now becoming rich dads. My husband
1:02:23
and I both like the poor dad. My husband earned a degree in physics and
1:02:29
planning a great books. It's time to prosper. Yep. That's certainly what they
1:02:33
all want. They want to prosper. So, we'll add that in here as well. Um, and
1:02:37
so this is like then then we've obviously got all these other books,
1:02:40
right? You can see that like one thing leads you down another thing, down
1:02:44
another thing, down another thing, and then you've got, you know, basically
1:02:48
you've fallen down all these different rabbit holes and you start to collect
1:02:51
all this information and then you're compiling it in this and when you're
1:02:54
done with this process, you just have like literally so much information in
1:02:59
this thing. It's incredible. Uh, so what I'll do is I will pause the video now
1:03:03
and I'll continue to do this research and fill this up so you you know the
1:03:08
areas that I'm going to be looking at, but I'm not going to show you the whole
1:03:10
cumbersome process of literally dredging through all of that. You'll be doing
1:03:14
that anyway in your own time and and filling all of that thing up. Okay,
1:03:19
guys, we are back. So, basically what you can see here, I I just spent another
1:03:25
hour or so and just filling this thing up even further. Um, and it's really
1:03:30
starting to come together with a whole lot of data. Like you you actually have
1:03:34
a look here. Let's just zoom into this thing for a moment. Um, and we start to
1:03:40
have a look like so for the newbie market. Like they what are some of their
1:03:43
hopes and dreams? They want to create a rental portfolio. They want an easy path
1:03:46
to riches. Um, they want to build wealth through investment property, get some
1:03:51
tenants and get rich. They want to save money, offset tax, create passive
1:03:56
income, real estate investing with no money. They want long-term net worth
1:04:00
growth. They want multiple rental properties, assets more than cover all
1:04:05
of their expenses. They want to make money and create wealth. Um, wealthy
1:04:11
living, live off passive income, hopefully hope hoping to eventually turn
1:04:15
into a full-time business, wealth creation with a focus on building
1:04:19
long-term portfolios. They want to quit their job um using real estate
1:04:25
investing. They want lifelong freedom, financial freedom, financial freedom
1:04:29
through real estate investing. They want to create wealth through property
1:04:33
investment. Just making money in a passive way where um they don't have to
1:04:38
think much um here using property as a vehicle to
1:04:44
retire early. So they want to retire early. Um and that's just the newbie
1:04:48
market. Then you've got the intermediate. They want to offset their
1:04:51
tax and um you use multiple rental properties. Um they want a second source
1:04:56
of reliable income. They want an asset that will produce regular income and
1:05:00
appreciate with value over time. Um and then there's some some common things as
1:05:05
well for the advanced ones. And then we go down to the pains and fears of this
1:05:09
market. Um losing money that it's a get-richqu scheme. Um significant
1:05:15
upfront costs. um not guaranteed tenant income every month, had money lenders
1:05:21
just trying to sell you a loan. Um so they they fear that they're just getting
1:05:26
pulled and roped into something that isn't going to be of their benefit.
1:05:29
Getting ripped off, buying in the wrong suburb or area. That was a big one. Um
1:05:34
buying property on a loan. Um risky if you can't afford the payments. What
1:05:39
happens if you don't have a renter at some point in time? Um I'd be screwed.
1:05:43
That was a direct comment. Um, I'm worried about taking a large loss,
1:05:48
defaulting on bank loans, not able to afford the mortgage, waiting for 20
1:05:51
years to retire from property. Um, that it's slow. Um, and they were a little
1:05:56
bit different for for the intermediate advance. Losing money, investing in
1:06:00
wrong location, losing money on the bad purchase thing, wrong location, not
1:06:03
guaranteed tenant income, losing money, pay too much for property, not being
1:06:07
able to find a tenant for their property. Right? Um, now the barriers
1:06:11
and uncertainties. There are a lot. There are a lot of things that we need
1:06:15
to answer. Uh, 20% deposit plus stamp duty plus legal fees to purchase a
1:06:19
property that you want. Um, was a comment by somebody. Um, it's hard
1:06:25
to beat the market by following the herd. Get-rich quick schemes. Is now a
1:06:29
good time to buy an investment property? Timing was a huge one. Significant
1:06:33
upfront costs. Waiting 20 years to retire from property. So, a lot of the
1:06:38
lot of crossover that from the fears and pains and fears. Um, I'd like to get
1:06:43
into property investment but don't know where slashw what to buy, how much to
1:06:46
borrow, how to maximize the tax benefits. So, perhaps I should speak to
1:06:50
a property investment advisor now as I have a second problem. How do I choose
1:06:54
an adviser who isn't going to rip me off? Or should I be looking for seminars
1:06:58
and publications or whatever? We are hopefully going to use the equity in our
1:07:02
current house to buy the new property. What tax breaks will we get? figure out
1:07:06
what we can afford. And the list goes on, you know, and you know, I'm going to
1:07:10
provide this template as an example for you guys to have a look. Um, and this by
1:07:15
no means is the full complete extensive list. You can go on, you can spend
1:07:21
weeks. I only spent a few hours on this. Um, unexpected insights comparing it to
1:07:26
the stock market, thinks it's a get-richqu scam. They're looking
1:07:29
specifically for smart property investing strategies. So not just any
1:07:33
they they specifically mentioned smart a lot of the time. So things that are
1:07:38
going against what the rest of the herd doing, things that are uncommon, things
1:07:41
that are smart. And then the term and the jargon and the niche specific
1:07:45
language, there's lots of them. Capital gain, positive, negative gearing,
1:07:50
neutral gear, OPM, LMI, stamp duty, IP, PPR, PP, CGT, IRA. Like there's just
1:07:57
there's so much that goes into this process, right? And this is really what
1:08:01
I call the raw materials. The raw materials of really putting together,
1:08:08
you know, what it is that is keeping your market up at night, their their
1:08:13
hopes and dreams, their pains and fears. What are the things that they're
1:08:16
thinking about, they're talking about online that they may not even be telling
1:08:20
their partner, right? It's just a huge amount of insights. Then once we've got
1:08:25
all of this information, then basically what it is time to do is to to collect
1:08:31
all of this information um and put it into like an avatar and a document and
1:08:37
creating creating your dream buyer avatar. So, what we'll do right now is
1:08:42
we'll dive on over to that. Um, and I'll run you through exactly what you want to
1:08:46
do with all these raw materials once you've used the Halo strategy to really
1:08:52
kind of just camp out inside of the mind of your dream buyer and find out what's
1:08:58
keeping them up at night tossing and turning, unable to sleep until they kind
1:09:03
of get this question answered and take this step in the right direction to move
1:09:07
towards what their desired end outcome is. It leads us to this next step, which
1:09:12
is creating your dream buyer avatar. And I've got a worksheet and everything like
1:09:18
that that I'm about to show you of exactly what to do step by step in order
1:09:22
to create your dream buyer avatar. But first, let me tell you a little bit
1:09:27
about why it's so important. And that is really about kind of knowing your dream
1:09:32
buyer really changes everything for you. It changes your product, your service
1:09:36
offering, your marketing strategy, your value proposition, your pricing, the
1:09:41
tone of your copies, and even what channels that you advertise on, and just
1:09:45
way, way more. Now, no one can afford to address
1:09:50
everyone's problems. So that's just the very first thing that I really want you
1:09:54
to kind of acknowledge that when I start running through people that the kind of
1:09:58
creating your dream buyer avatar and start really trying to find out who
1:10:02
their dream buyer is, the very first kind of defense mechanism that they have
1:10:06
is well I I don't want to single anybody out like I want to talk to everybody
1:10:11
like I want to go for the entire market. Now the thing is it's impossible to
1:10:16
address everyone's pro problems and especially in today's market conditions
1:10:21
where the media that we use to reach our customers is so highly fragmented.
1:10:26
Right? If your business is going to compete with the big guys, you have like
1:10:30
to really zero in on who that dream buyer is. Otherwise, you're kind of
1:10:35
going out there with a shotgun and you're scattering all these bullets all
1:10:38
over the place where, you know, you really need a sniper rifle and you
1:10:42
really just need to kind of zone in on who that dream buyer is for you. And a
1:10:46
lot of business owners simply say like, look, I'm targeting whoever is
1:10:50
interested in my services. Um, or you know, some say that their target market
1:10:55
is business owners or homeowners or property investors or mothers. Um, and
1:11:00
while that can kind of be a good start, like singling out at least somebody to
1:11:03
target, these targets are much too general to really go after. And
1:11:09
specificity is key because you're going to want to be talking to the people in
1:11:13
the language that they use. And you want to be when you write your copy and when
1:11:17
you structure up your offers and do all of your marketing, it you want your
1:11:22
dream buyer to feel as if you are literally specifically talking to them.
1:11:27
and all the pains and fears and hopes and dreams that they specifically has.
1:11:31
And then that's how you get cut through. That's how you can really just get
1:11:35
through all of the noise and just use the signal and just beam in on the
1:11:39
forehead of your dream buyer. And this thing is insanely powerful when you put
1:11:44
it to use. Now, while defining your dream buyer might seem like you're kind
1:11:50
of excluding other audiences who might buy from you, what you need to do is
1:11:54
keep in mind that targeting a specific dream buyer doesn't mean that you need
1:11:59
to exclude anyone who doesn't fit that criteria. It just means that we're
1:12:04
trying to make our marketing material much more magnetic to that dream buyer
1:12:09
and repel the people that we don't want to work with. However, it will also
1:12:14
there will be people on the fringes that fall just outside of that dream buyer
1:12:18
criteria, but are still going to be really pulled towards our marketing
1:12:22
message if it's solving a big problem. Now, the purpose of going after your
1:12:26
dream buyer is really just to focus your message and your marketing budget on
1:12:31
whichever market is the most likely to buy your products or your services. and
1:12:36
really as well as getting those prospects who would be that dream buyer
1:12:40
for you attracted into your business. So, we're really kind of focusing on
1:12:44
that 4% of prospects are going to really bring in 64% of the revenue and the
1:12:49
profits like we spoke about before. Now, when you do this um and you focus
1:12:56
specifically on that dream buyer, it brings clarity your to your marketing
1:13:00
message and your copy becomes sharp and hard like the tip of a spear and it
1:13:05
really just cuts through all the noise in your marketplace, which ultimately
1:13:09
means like a more profitable business for yourself because there's less
1:13:13
wastage. And look, while you might be thinking that creating a dream buyer
1:13:17
persona isn't the sexiest thing, let me just tell you this, right? Advertising
1:13:22
channels change, landing page building software changes, algorithms change,
1:13:28
tactics on Facebook and Google change, but the fundamentals of learning what
1:13:33
people want, understanding exactly where you can help them and then telling the
1:13:39
right people about it is the most persuasive thing and the really the most
1:13:43
timeless strategy that has worked for the last hundred years and it will work
1:13:48
for the next 100 years. Right? So, this is something that it might not seem like
1:13:53
a shiny object and super sexy, but this is just my secret weapon where it has
1:13:58
allowed me to just go into multiple markets and understand that market more
1:14:03
intimately than any of my competitors and just dominate and annihilate them
1:14:08
and crush them because I'm speaking to a market and my marketing message is just
1:14:12
having so much more impact and clarity. So, this really is the most important
1:14:18
step amongst everything because if you get this process right, then everything
1:14:23
else from this point on is going to be easy and you're just going to be fitting
1:14:27
the pieces of the puzzle together and getting just incredibly powerful
1:14:31
marketing that really just allows you to stand out head and shoulders above what
1:14:36
all of your competitors are doing. Now, let me run you through um the dream
1:14:42
buyer avatar worksheet. And it's just really a series of questions that you go
1:14:46
out into your marketplace with and you answer. And at the end of it, after
1:14:50
using the Halo strategy worksheet in com in combining that with the dream buyer
1:14:55
avatar worksheet is just you're going to have like just the most visceral and
1:14:59
real dream buyer avatar that your marketing message is just going to be
1:15:04
like a samurai sword. So, let me just run you through this and show you how
1:15:08
this whole thing works. Okay, so here we are on the dream buyer
1:15:13
avatar worksheet and you've got a link to this in the resource section of this
1:15:18
video. Um, and basically after we've gone out and we've kind of understand
1:15:23
what are their hopes and fears, pains and dreams, what you can do is you can
1:15:27
work your way through this sheet and really start to flesh out exactly what
1:15:34
the avatar looks like and what is like a day in your dream buyer's life looks
1:15:39
like. like what time are they waking up? What are they doing? And you can read
1:15:43
through this and you can see like typically when you talk about like
1:15:46
avatars, people just do this and they stop,
1:15:50
right? They do the age, the name, um the location, the relationship, education,
1:15:56
um job, occupation, income, location, and that's like wow. They feel like wow,
1:16:00
I've done a really really good job at understanding my dream by avatar. Um,
1:16:05
but you know what I have found is that while it's not the most sexy thing again
1:16:11
like the thing that you need to remember that having like just reading this for
1:16:15
you right getting clear on who your dream buyer is and then relentlessly
1:16:18
focusing on them brings clarity to your marketing message. Your copy becomes
1:16:23
sharp and hard like the tip of a spear that cuts through all the noise in your
1:16:28
marketplace which ultimately leads to a more profitable business. Right? Because
1:16:32
if you're advertising against the same competitors, literally the only
1:16:36
difference is what you say on your ads and on your landing pages. And if you
1:16:41
can say things that resonate with your dream buyer more than all the
1:16:46
competitors, then guess what? You're the one that's going to go get the lion's
1:16:50
share of business in that marketplace. And the thing to note is that
1:16:53
advertising channels change, landing page building software changes,
1:16:56
algorithms change, tactics change, but the fundamentals of learning what people
1:17:01
want and understanding exactly where you can help them and then telling the right
1:17:06
people about it is in the most persuasive way is a timeless strategy
1:17:11
that worked 100 years ago and it will work 100red years from now. So this is
1:17:16
extremely important. Once again, um you'll read through this. I'm not going
1:17:20
to read through everything on because this video is becoming quite long. Um,
1:17:24
but you can break down and you can see all of the different things like
1:17:29
thinking about where they're hanging out, where do they get their information
1:17:32
from, where do they congregate online, um, where does your dream buyer get
1:17:36
their information, what is their biggest frustrations and challenges. You know,
1:17:39
this we've just gone and got these raw materials from this in the Halo strategy
1:17:44
worksheet and you can put those in here. But this is also about like fleshing
1:17:49
those things out and making them become a little bit real. And it's not going to
1:17:53
be based off assumptions, but you are going to put connecting words and things
1:17:57
on there just to make it like a real avatar and a real person. And then every
1:18:01
time that you sit down to write any ad or to write an email or anything, you're
1:18:07
looking at this avatar. you're get you're putting yourself in their shoes
1:18:10
and really thinking about all of their pains and fears, their hopes and dreams,
1:18:15
their frustrations, and everything that they're going through and what their day
1:18:19
is like. If you can when you send an email to them, you want to think about
1:18:22
like somebody is dramatically different on a Monday morning at 8:00 a.m. to what
1:18:28
they are at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday, right? So when you communicate with them
1:18:33
by going through this process and knowing what like a day in the life of
1:18:36
theirs looks like you'll know how to communicate with them. And this is
1:18:39
really really deep and highlevel stuff that that nobody does. Now the other
1:18:46
thing that so you got this worksheet you can work through it. But the other thing
1:18:49
that I want to go through is you might be thinking well Subrey how do I know
1:18:52
their age? How do I know their education or they're in a relationship or any of
1:18:56
these things? Um well let me just show you a little ninja tool that I use.
1:19:00
which is Facebook audience insights. Um, and then we want to click on everyone on
1:19:08
Facebook. And you can come here. Um, we don't want
1:19:12
the United States. So, let's cuz for this one we're using Australia. Um, so
1:19:17
let's put in Australia here. And then basically what you want to do is come
1:19:23
down to interest and type in property investment.
1:19:32
Okay, not enough information. So you want to keep adding on here. You can see
1:19:36
that there's multiple things under property um
1:19:44
investment. There's property investing. Um, keep building it out,
1:19:53
adding more. Then we've got real estate investing,
1:20:00
and it's going to start to build out now as we keep populating. So, you want to
1:20:04
basically just keep on thinking of anything else in these different
1:20:09
markets. Break it up
1:20:33
until they're all gone. All right, that's what you want to do.
1:20:38
Now, look at this. Look what Facebook is giving us. So they're saying that in
1:20:41
Australia that they found 700,000 to 800,000 people that match these these
1:20:47
interests, right? And now it's going it's giving us a breakdown of gender,
1:20:52
their ages, all of this stuff. So you can see that like you've got everyone
1:20:57
from 18 all the way up to 65 plus. And of course, you've got men and women. Now
1:21:02
the skew for this one is very close. 51 um to 49 women, right? 49% women, 51%
1:21:09
men. So typically for this I wouldn't be saying like you know you can pick one
1:21:16
and talk to both of them. So for instance for this we might say that the
1:21:20
name of the person is property Pete right um you can pick a
1:21:29
girl it doesn't really matter right it's whoever your audience is really going to
1:21:33
be and then what you can see here is that like the like the majority of the
1:21:39
people that are in here are age 25 to 34 and then the next biggest group is 35 to
1:21:45
44. So, in our statement that we made earlier, we're pretty close, right? So,
1:21:49
what I would do is I'd pick the middle of these two and just go cool. We're
1:21:53
going to go with 35. Um, so they're 35. Then from this as well, we can see
1:22:01
what's the next thing on here, their education level. Um, we'll work through
1:22:06
this list before we go into all of that. So, first of all, the other thing that
1:22:10
we can see is that 56% of them are married, right? So that's what we're
1:22:15
going with, right? This person relationship, they're married.
1:22:23
Now, what else do we have? Their education, 66% of them went to college,
1:22:29
right? So when we come here and we go education,
1:22:36
college educated. Now what we can do here which is also
1:22:42
awesome is the job insights right and you can click on see all and it gives
1:22:47
you a breakdown and you can see that the area that there is a huge skew towards
1:22:53
is management and sales. So you know there there's more on this. So
1:23:01
we'll go management
1:23:08
for this. Um we'll just write business manager, right? You can put in whatever
1:23:13
and you can dive into it even more more granularly if you wish to, right? Um so
1:23:20
you can see a full breakdown of this, right? And these are the top 10. Um you
1:23:25
can say like, you know, they're an IT manager if you want. um or do you want
1:23:29
to combine these twos, which is a good idea. Let's just say they're a sales
1:23:32
manager. Okay. Now, as we come across over to here, what is also a really
1:23:38
great thing um is you can go page likes and you can start to see other pages
1:23:47
that have these people that have these interests are liking and what what are
1:23:50
the are are those pages. Um, and then these these further help you flesh out
1:23:56
and do your halo strategy. So, one thing that I didn't go into in great detail is
1:24:01
basically what you can do is then go, you know, I love real estate, open up
1:24:06
the their Facebook page here, and you can start reading through their posts
1:24:11
and their comments and start to say what what what people are seeing in this
1:24:15
market. Right? So, this is another really great place to go. Another thing
1:24:20
that I like to do is to basically go to Facebook groups and type in property
1:24:27
investment. Um, not global, just type in property investment. And then what you
1:24:32
want to do here is look at groups. All right? And then you want to join these
1:24:38
groups. And then the same process apply that we use in the strate in in the Halo
1:24:42
strategy. we want to dive into it deep and have a look exactly what these
1:24:47
people are saying and what is it that they're doing. Okay. Um then based on
1:24:52
this you can go to location and you can see that literally like
1:24:58
almost 50% or 45% of them are living in Melbourne or Sydney. So we're going to
1:25:04
say this person lives in Sydney. interest. We know that because we can
1:25:11
just come back to this and like you can see like look at these like
1:25:18
you can they're like cars, furniture, um public figures, motor vehicle
1:25:25
companies. They're like ran Land Rovers like so they probably drive a Land
1:25:29
Rover. Um these are the companies that they like. And you can fill this out,
1:25:33
right? You can put in a few things on here.
1:25:38
So you might say luxury cars, interior,
1:25:45
design, furniture,
1:25:51
and furniture, right? You can dig into all those pages and make it even more
1:25:55
fleshed out as well. Um, but you can see that once you do this information, you
1:26:02
get all this, you put them in here, and then you fill this up using all the
1:26:08
information and all the raw materials that you got from the Halo strategy
1:26:11
worksheet. Like you are just absolutely miles ahead. Sorry, this last income
1:26:17
one. Um, so you used to be able to come to Facebook. Facebook used to be able to
1:26:22
give you that data. depending on where you are in the world, if you're in the
1:26:25
States, um a lot of the time they still give out that information um where
1:26:28
they'll give you like what kind of bracket the income level of what they're
1:26:32
earning. But we we don't have that here in Australia. Um so you can see though
1:26:36
by all the comments that people were leaving in the Halo strategy that people
1:26:40
were saying, I'm on, you know, 75K, I'm on 100K, I'm on this. You want to pick
1:26:44
the medium and then just put in what is that what is that that it is going to be
1:26:49
on average from all the people that you see. Um, and then you have a really
1:26:54
really fleshed out dream buyer worksheet and you know exactly who you you're
1:27:00
talking to. And as I said, like when you put together your ads, your landing
1:27:04
pages, your copy, they are going to absolutely strike like lightning. And
1:27:08
people are going to be like, you're going to get comments and emails and
1:27:12
I've even had handwritten letters. I get them all the time where people like, I
1:27:16
felt like you you were in my head talking to me. And that's because I am.
1:27:20
and I've spent the time and all the energy in doing this stuff where you
1:27:25
actually know exactly what's going on inside your prospect's head. So, we'll
1:27:31
go back to the slides and I'll run you through some last minute stuff before we
1:27:34
wrap up. So, there you have it, guys. That is like the whole process that I go
1:27:40
through from start to finish of really researching my market using the Halo
1:27:46
strategy and then basically inputting all of those raw materials into the
1:27:50
dream buyer avatar worksheet and creating that avatar and finding out
1:27:56
exactly their age, their location, their interests and all the stuff using
1:28:00
technology. So it's not guesswork. I'm not sitting down in the traditional
1:28:05
sense of creating a buyer avatar and just using all these esoteric things.
1:28:09
I'm actually using hard data. So, both of the resources from the dream buyer
1:28:14
avatar worksheet is included in the resources section along with the Halo
1:28:18
strategy and the example template that I filled out throughout this training
1:28:22
video. So, let's look at the action items. The first thing for you to do is
1:28:27
if you've already got a whole bunch of customers is really dig into the data of
1:28:31
your business and identify your dream buyer. That dream buyer that represents,
1:28:36
you know, the 20% of customers that are driving 80% of your sales volume or 80%
1:28:42
of your profits. As I said, it needs to be a combination of both. There's only
1:28:46
one or two huge clients that are making up for a massive amount of the profits
1:28:51
because they're just few and far between. They're typically harder to
1:28:54
catch. Um, then you want to use the halo strategy. And please do not rush this
1:28:59
process. Like you saw throughout this training video, you know how long this
1:29:04
is. And this is not even nowhere near as deep as I go when I actually do it for
1:29:08
my own business and for clients businesses. So this is something that
1:29:12
you really want to think about, really want to dive into super super deep.
1:29:15
spend the time it you know there is effort required in order to get this
1:29:20
done but I assure you once you do this everything else becomes easy you're no
1:29:27
longer wondering anything you know without a shadow of a doubt exactly
1:29:31
what's going on in your marketplace then organize and study your findings should
1:29:36
be something that you reflect upon often whenever you write you know any copy any
1:29:41
emails any webinars anything you should be looking at this document You should
1:29:46
really be getting in the shoes and in the mind of that buyer when you're
1:29:50
writing copy. That's how you write copy that really strikes. Do you know what I
1:29:54
mean? I have gone up and just obliterated A-level copywriters because
1:29:59
I knew the bullseye of that marketplace. I knew what that market wanted. It's not
1:30:04
about just creating super high converting sales copy and words, right?
1:30:09
It's not about words. It's about salesmanship. And the way that you find
1:30:13
out how to sell a prospect is to find out exactly what it is that they want
1:30:17
and how can you help them get that and how can you position your product, your
1:30:21
service, your copy in a way that fulfills on that. And then the last
1:30:26
point is to create your dream buyer avatar. As I said, spend the time on
1:30:31
this. Flesh this thing out so it is absolutely real. It is visceral. then
1:30:37
use the Facebook audience insights to really flesh out the exact psychoraphics
1:30:42
and demographics and the location and all of that kind of stuff of your dream
1:30:45
buyer. So that there's a lot of things to cover. Go ahead, get to work and I
1:30:50
will see you in the next video.

Dream Buyer Avatar Worksheet
Getting clear on who your Dream Buyer is and then relentlessly focusing on them, brings clarity to your marketing message. Your copy becomes sharp and hard like the tip of a spear that cuts through the noise in your marketplace, which ultimately leads to a more profitable business.
Advertising channels change. Landing page builder software changes. Algorithms change. Tactics change. But the fundamentals of learning what people want, understanding exactly where you can help them, and then telling the right people about it in the most persuasive way, is a timeless strategy that worked 100 years ago and will work 100 years from now.

Facebook Audience Insights Tool >
1.    Where does your dream buyer hang out and congregate?
Name both online and offline places where your dream buyers hang out and congregate. The more detailed and specific, the better.
‘Hangs out on Facebook’ is too general.
‘Hangs out in the Mothers of Melbourne Facebook group’ is more precise and actionable.
‘Likes the outdoors’ is too general to mean anything insightful and actionable.
‘Likes going to the park every Saturday morning with her two kids’ shows habits and values and is specific.
‘Reads blogs’ isn’t targeted enough.
‘Obsessively reads Rockin Mama, Mamavation, and Reddit’ is defined and revealing.
Knowing exactly where your dream buyers are hanging out influences a lot of things including where you should advertise, what you should advertise, the tone of your copy, and vernacular to use.
2.  Where does your dream buyer get their information?
When your dream buyer is in research mode, where do they go to find the answers they seek? Is it Google? A particular blog? Books? Magazines? YouTube?
Write your findings as a simple sentence: ‘When Sally is curious about a topic, the first place she goes is Google search on her iPhone’.
3.  What are their biggest frustrations and challenges?
Truly understanding and empathising with their biggest frustrations and challenges are the most important keys to defining your dream buyer avatar.
By knowing what it’s like walking in your customer’s shoes, you’ll be able to create better products and services that address their specific pain points and problems.
Here are a few examples to get your creative juices flowing: ‘I wish someone would just write this sales copy for me’. ‘I need to lose ten kilos before my wedding’.
‘Ugh. I wish I could just have someone run my Facebook ads for me’.
Your dream buyer’s frustrations and challenges are integral to the products and services you offer. Whatever it is you are selling has to solve a problem large enough that your dream buyer will happily part with their hard- earned money for you to solve it for them.
Knowing their biggest frustration and challenges also will determine the emotions you speak to in your copy and advertising. There are a number of emotions behind


 
the challenges and frustrations your dream buyer is experiencing – they could be sadness, anger, fear, remorse, hope, a desire for something better. By speaking to exactly what your dream buyer is feeling, you’ll be able to connect with them emotionally on more than just a rational level.
It will also reflect the types of stories you tell. The logic here is simple. When your dream buyer sees a testimonial from a customer who solved their biggest frustrations and challenges with your product or service, then they are more likely to buy from you. They can see this positive transformation take place in someone else.


4.  What are their hopes, dreams, and desires?
Knowing your dream buyer’s hopes, dreams and desires helps you paint a vivid picture of what life could be like after using your products and services. Think of it as selling the dream and painting a picture of the Promised Land.
When your products or services help your dream buyer attain their hopes, dreams, and desires, it becomes much easier to write copy for your landing pages, website, ads, and other assets you leverage to sell more goods and services.
Here are a few examples of copy written to speak to a dream buyer’s desires:
  



 5.  What are their biggest fears?
What are your dream buyer’s deepest fears? What keeps them up at night, tossing and turning, unable to sleep? What do they worry about in their mind but never tell anyone? Fully understanding your market’s deepest and most primal fears is an often overlooked component to crafting a customer avatar. However, in my opinion, it’s equally as important, if not more, than understanding their hopes, dreams, and desires. Why? People are motivated more by pain than they are by pleasure. They are more motivated by fear of loss than they are by the desire to gain something. Therefore, calling out their fears in your copy and ads is an incredibly important element to get your dream buyer to take action and motivate them to move away from what they fear most.
A good example of fear used to motivate people into taking action is the approach used by insurance companies. They call out their prospects’ deepest fears more than they do the benefits of getting covered.
Example:
‘Life insurance can help ease your worries that your loved ones will be taken care of and may not have to deal with the financial strain that could arise from you no longer being around, or the financial hardship that can impact your kids through their surviving parent. If you have a partner, would he or she be able to take care of the kids without your help? Prevent your partner’s financial hardship affecting your kids’ welfare and future’.
6.  What is their preferred form of communication?
Email? Text? Chat? Facebook Live? Or do they prefer physical mail? This is a matter of where your audience wants you to communicate with them. The fundamental lesson here is to communicate with your customers where they already are. Don’t try and move them onto something that is more convenient for you rather than where they already are.


7.  What phrases, exact language, and vernacular do they use?


‘Enter the conversation already taking place in the customer’s mind’.
You see, there is already language and niche-specific terms being used in your customer’s mind for their hopes, dreams, pain, fears, and desires. Your job is to listen and write them down. What industry terminology are they using, what specific vernacular and niche-specific terms?
When using The Halo Strategy to conduct research on where your buyers are hanging out and congregating, you must document the exact phrases and terminology they use and store them in a spreadsheet to spark ideas for website copy, landing pages, and ads. Take specific comments from Reddit, Facebook Group, or YouTube, and document your audience’s word-for-word responses.
In today’s day and age, scepticism is rampant. Now more than ever, people are attracted to people (and businesses) who speak their language, get  their  sense  of  humour, or share the same point of view. Every time they read your copy, your goal is for your dream buyer to say to themselves, ‘Whoa, it’s like they’re talking directly to me’.
8.  What does a day in your dream buyer’s life look like?
7:05am - Mike wakes up to the sound of marimbas on his iPhone’s alarm clock.
7:15am – Checks his inbox to make sure the world isn’t coming to an end from any emails that came in overnight. Then opens up Instagram to see who’s commenting and liking his latest post.


 
8:10am - Brews the new Colombian roast using his shiny new French press.
8:32am - Stuck in traffic on Punt road listening to his favourite Drake playlist on Spotify.
9:03am - Gets into the office.
9:18am - Checks email and calendar.
10:01am – Checks the stats in Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and custom dashboard.
10:40am – Has a meeting with his team about current week.
12:05pm - Eats favourite Poké bowl from new hipster joint on the corner.
1:12pm – On his way back to the office, checks Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
2:04pm - Afternoon lull, wishing his office had a nap pod for him to have a siesta.
2:38pm – Write new Facebook Ads and email sequence.
4:05pm - Brainstorms how to generate more leads to meet quarterly growth goals and revenue targets.
6:15pm - Drives home ready for a House of Cards marathon on Netflix.
Imagining what your ideal customer’s daily life looks like adds an incredible personal element to your marketing.  It also becomes practical – when is the best time to email


 
your prospects? When are they most likely to respond? When are they most attentive?
Your dream buyer is a completely different person at 8am on a Monday morning than at 6:30pm on a Friday. Be aware of this and use it in your marketing.
9.  What makes them happy?
The customer journey is more than the exchange of money for goods and services. Your clients are emotional beings, and people want to interact with companies and brands that make them feel good about themselves.
Where are the touch points in your dream buyer’s journey where you can insert surprises, do the unexpected, be remarkable, and bring a smile to their face? Maybe it’s a handwritten thank-you note after signing up for your service, a personalised email sent on their birthday, or a free box full of company swag and cookies (who doesn’t love cookies?).
Inserting happiness into the buyer’s journey can create a deeper level of emotional connection that cultivates loyal and raving fans for the long term.








The End Result
After answering all of these questions, write a paragraph summarising your findings. It could look like this summary of Sally, the dream buyer for a new app focused on environmentally-friendly mothers:
‘Sally loves spending time reading stories and getting tips from other mums, and learning about parenthood in the Mothers of Melbourne Facebook group. It’s a much cherished pastime of hers. Her biggest frustration being a mother of two is simply that there is not enough hours in the day to do everything. When she’s in research mode, the first place she goes is Google on her iPad in the kitchen. 
She’s a frequent (kinda obsessive) visitor of mummy blogs like Rockin Mama and Mamavation. Her life-long dream is to start her own interior design business, so she can have a creative outlet and more ‘me time’. Last week when she was shopping at her local farmers market and browsing Instagram, an ad popped up with an invitation to download a new app for environmentally-friendly cleaning products’.
The end result is a much deeper, more intimate understanding of where and how to reach your dream buyers, and how to speak to them. The compounding result will cause massive breakthroughs that geometrically grow your business and allow you to dominate your market.
Defining your target market is one of the hardest parts of starting a business. The good news is that once you do it, everything else will quickly start falling into place. You just have to figure out which medium to use to effectively reach them, and which marketing strategies they respond to.

Transcript 1.5


Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to this module of quantum growth called
0:15
the larger market formula. And in this module, I'm going to be really showing
0:20
you how we break down any given market and where the buyers are hiding in any
0:26
given market. And really it's a paradigm shift from say for instance if you are
0:32
having a conversation with a small group of people in a room and you had to pay
0:37
to have those people attend that that meeting in a room where you're going to
0:40
be talking to them and using the same amount of money that it would cost to
0:46
get those people in the room. that instead of having a conversation to, you
0:50
know, 1 2 3 or four people, you would actually be in a sports arena in front
0:54
of 90,000 people for the exact same amount of money with all of your
1:00
marketing dollars that you invest. And that's exactly what I'm going to show
1:03
you how to do in today's module. Before we get into all the weeds and the exact
1:07
specifics of it, let me show you what we'll be covering. So we'll be going
1:10
over the gate of Xerxes, the larger market formula in granular detail,
1:15
market sophistication and terrorizing the competition.
1:21
So the gates of Xerxes, as I refer to it, is really the convergence and the
1:26
barrier of people moving from offline to online and how people are actually
1:32
buying in the 21st century. So as I stated before like you know e-commerce
1:38
is exploding right now and it is completely eating traditional physical
1:43
brick and mortar spending right well let's take a look at the actual figures
1:48
first in the US then globally now if you look at the US spending it's now at
1:53
around $450 billion per year but if you zoom out and look at retail spending
2:01
it's clear to see that only like e-commerce only still represents around
2:04
10% % of US retail spending. Now, if you add in bars and restaurants,
2:10
which are only now starting to get addressed from technology, it gets even
2:14
smaller, right? Then it's interesting to look into the retail
2:20
spending to see what it actually looks like. And you can see that like gas
2:24
stations um are going to be completely transformed and likely to disappear over
2:28
the next 20 years. Then there's car parts and maintenance and all that is
2:33
kind of going away or completely getting transformed and relocated in the next 10
2:39
years as well. Um, which is largely due to to this company Tesla. But then
2:44
there's also the rest of US retail spending which is now over $10 trillion.
2:52
Then if you zoom out and actually look at the share of this and what we've
2:56
taken so far of the opportunity, you can see that it's much smaller, right? When
3:01
you put in the all kind of spending, it's only like 4%.
3:05
Now if you zoom out again and look at the global e-commerce market what you
3:10
can see here is like you know you got USA you got western Europe you got China
3:15
and all other and you look at the total amount of spending in terms of how that
3:21
marketplace is is just made up and what that looks like and the growth of it you
3:25
know from 2005 to 2016 like look at China right and it's just it's crazy to
3:32
see what's going on and then this stat that I showed you in in an earlier
3:36
module which is really like if you zoom out and look at like USA in the total
3:40
e-commerce share of retail spending you can see again that they're only small
3:45
numbers right now even though the e-commerce penetration is still only
3:49
just at 10%. We have a fundamental shift in where the attention is and where it's
3:55
going and what we can do with that. So, you might be thinking, why are you
3:58
talking about e-commerce and all of these stats, Subbury? You know, we're
4:02
talking about consulting and we're talking about coaching and service-based
4:06
businesses and attracting leads and, you know, I'm not selling widgets online and
4:09
I get that, but it's still it's very important to zoom out and look at those
4:14
macro trends and how they are affecting how people are buying because I'm about
4:18
to go into how that's going to affect you with actually selling a service and
4:22
generating leads. Because the most important thing to do is to look where
4:26
the attention is flowing, right? Because at the end of the day, you know,
4:31
business is all first about one getting attention from the people that have the
4:36
problem that you can help them solve. Um, and then once you've got their
4:40
attention is then using that attention to basically persuade them that you are
4:46
the company that they want to do business with and then delivering on
4:50
that persuasion element and actually helping them solve that problem. Right?
4:53
So it's very important to look at these trends and understand where people are
4:57
going and what's happening as a society that you know we're operating and
5:01
conducting our business with. And you know, as we went over, like the internet
5:06
now is the number one channel in terms of advertising and getting new customers
5:10
out of all the other channels. And consumers are online an average of 6
5:18
hours and 42 minutes each and every day. Which really begs the question that that
5:25
I often think about is if everyone is online, then what is it that they're
5:31
doing, right? You've got all these people online spending like almost 7
5:36
hours a day online. Um, and if we have a look at these stats, let's have a look.
5:40
These are the the the key direct to consumer stats. So, 87% of shoppers now
5:45
begin product searches online. People spend on average
5:51
5 hours per week shopping online. and 0.56 or 56 cents of every dollar
5:58
spent in an offline store is influenced by a digital interaction. And even
6:05
though this is e-commerce, I'm going to be going into the lead genen stats in a
6:08
moment. Just think about that. 56 cents of every dollar that is spent in an
6:13
offline store is influenced by a digital interaction. And that is just showing
6:20
that like well that's what's happening. There's all these eyeballs online and
6:23
and they are really influencing that total commerce worldwide and what's
6:29
happening. And even though those transactions aren't taking place online,
6:33
56 cents of every dollar spent in offline store is influenced by an online
6:38
interaction which shows exactly how important this stuff is.
6:43
So really what we're seeing is that they're researching online and then
6:48
they're buying offline. And this is also changing to they're researching online,
6:53
trying offline, and then they're buying online. So they go research online, try
6:58
offline, and buy online, right? And that's typically what you're seeing in
7:01
terms of like showrooming and all these things that's happening. However, this
7:06
is really still only represents a fraction of the opportunity. And this is
7:10
indicative of what we see with conversion rates for e-commerce stores,
7:15
right? Because the average e-commerce conversion rate globally across all
7:20
industries, all websites and everything is 2.86%.
7:25
Right? So literally you get 100 people coming to a website and less than 3% of
7:31
those people are buying anything. Right now let's move away from the direct to
7:36
consumer and e-commerce side of stuff and start to look at the B2B. Um, now
7:40
today's B2B buyer makes an average of 12 searches
7:44
online and looks for the same digital experience that they encounter during
7:50
the BTOC sales cycle. And that's the reason that I show you these stats
7:54
because, you know, everyone's buying things online, right? And everybody has
7:58
bought something online and we typically interact with like BTOC transactions and
8:06
buying things direct to consumer and business to consumer in a much more
8:10
frequent basis than we do than when we buy off businesses typically, right? And
8:14
what's happening is because we are exposed to that more often, then we're
8:20
starting to really expect that same experience when we're buying in a B2B
8:26
environment. Right? So this is radically changing the way that business is made
8:31
up when you're selling to another business even because they're expecting
8:36
that same experience and transparency and being able to see all of the stuff
8:40
that they would see in a direct to consumer play in a B2B play.
8:45
And B2B buyers are already 57% of the way through the buying process before
8:51
the first meeting with a representative. So before they even pick up the phone
8:55
and call you or call and speak to your salesperson,
8:59
57% they're already 57% of the way through
9:04
their buying process. Meaning that they've gone out there and collated
9:08
information. They've already been comparing companies before you've even
9:12
had the opportunity to speak to them. And that's a really really clear and key
9:16
distinction to make. And that's really evident what by the stat above about,
9:21
you know, B2B buyers expecting the same experience that they encounter with a B
9:25
TOC company because they're already using information online in that same
9:30
way where they're almost 60% their decision is made before they're even
9:34
speaking to you, which is radically different to how it's been done in the
9:38
past. right now. Over 73% of B2B technology buyers are 20 to 35 years
9:46
old, making them the single largest demographic, right? A lot of people
9:51
talking about like, oh, you know, it's always the older people. The older
9:55
people are the ones that are making all of these big buying decisions and have
9:58
all the big money to spend and they're the guys that we want to attack. Well,
10:02
73% of all B2B technology buyers are 20 to 35, right? So that's going to change
10:08
dramatically how you communicate to those people. And you know these t
10:12
people typically you know we're at the fringe of growing up in the internet age
10:16
and are definitely going to be wanting and experiencing um wanting an
10:20
experience that is more seamless and more is like a BTOC play than it is a
10:24
B2B play. So let's what what about lead
10:28
generation? Well, on average, right, the average lead generation website
10:34
worldwide converts at 4.31%. So again, right, you have 100 people
10:42
coming to your website or your landing pages
10:45
and less than 5% of those people are ever converting.
10:51
So 95% of the people, they're walking out of the room, they're leaving your
10:55
website and that's it. Poof, they're gone. you'll never ever hear from them
10:58
again. You don't have them as a lead. Right? So, if 87% of purchases start
11:05
online, but less than 3 to 4% of them convert online, what is it that people
11:11
are looking for? Like if someone is on Google and they're specifically
11:15
searching for something and then you're getting a hundred of those people that
11:18
are specifically searching for something or they're coming from Facebook or
11:21
whatever, where wherever it is and they're coming through to your website
11:25
or your landing page, right, looking for what it is that you do, but only 3 to 4%
11:31
of them ever convert online. Then what is going on? Like what is it that these
11:36
people are looking for? And the answer is information.
11:41
For the longest time, the salesperson was the gatekeeper of information. And
11:46
the buyer would basically meet with as many different sales reps and
11:50
salespeople during that information gathering phase, right? To collect all
11:55
the information. And like salespeople would really not tell you anything until
12:01
you got on the phone with them. And all the information would be held very close
12:04
to their chest. And in order to find out any information about that business, you
12:10
would have to call their sales rep. And that has fundamentally changed, right?
12:15
You can see it from these stats is that people no longer want that to be the
12:20
case. Like they have been they're 57% of the way through that buying process
12:25
before they even reach out to you. And that's because we're living in this
12:29
instant age where we expect that businesses, regardless of whether or not
12:34
they're selling a service or they're selling to a business, to have enough
12:37
information out in the public domain that you can collect that and go through
12:42
it in your own time without having to speak with a sales rep, which is very
12:46
threatening and it's not convenient to that end user to find out exactly what
12:51
is going on. So, there's been that shift, right? I see salespeople
12:57
that are still operating like it was like, you know, 10, 20 years ago. Like
13:02
the old advice of like when you call a prospect, never leave a voicemail. Like
13:08
that's the most stupid and dishonest thing ever. And the reason that they say
13:12
that is because then they're going to know that you're a saleserson and then
13:15
they're not going to call you back, right? And it's just a ridiculous
13:20
situation to put somebody in and it's dishonest. And the internet has
13:25
disrupted that and it's changing that. It's like, okay, if you don't have
13:28
enough information on your website for me, then you're not going to even be put
13:32
into the pool of potential people that I'm going to do business with because
13:37
it's inconvenient for me and I already want to be almost 60% of the way through
13:41
my information and buying process before I even have to speak to you. There might
13:46
be some questions that I want you to have to answer. There might be some
13:49
things that are not clear. I want some comparisons. But by and large, I've 60%
13:55
made my decision before I even speak to you. Now, as fascinating as that is,
14:00
there's something that is way more important at play here. Because if
14:04
everyone is searching for information and everyone's online, they're searching
14:09
on Google, they're looking for information, then why is everybody just
14:13
trying to sell them? like it really just doesn't make any sense at all. And if
14:17
your offers are just screaming by by and they're not valuable and they're not
14:24
educational in nature, then you are missing out on just a huge huge
14:32
potential of your total market. 97% right if we look at the average
14:36
conversion rates. So, you're missing out on 97% of the total number of buyers in
14:43
your market because you're leading with a buy by buy message, right? And you're
14:50
withholding the information in order for your sales team to be able
14:55
to get on the phone and then try to close them or for you to get on the
14:58
phone and try to close them. Which brings us to the larger market formula.
15:05
And really what the larger market formula shows is that in any given
15:10
market only 3% of your prospects are looking to buy right now. And these are
15:18
the guys that are intensely interested in solving a problem or fulfilling a
15:22
desire that they have right now. They have the most urgent problem that they
15:28
have to get solved. All right? And these are people who are trying to decide
15:32
whether or not to buy from you or one of your competitors. And if you're like
15:38
most business people, right, and most co coaches and consultants and
15:42
service-based businesses that I see, this is where all of your attention is
15:46
going, okay, and you're just obsessively focusing on this. And this is like where
15:52
the waters are the most bloody with competition because everybody is going
15:56
for these people. Then you have 17% and these 17% of prospects are what we call
16:04
they're in information gathering mode and these are like window shoppers who
16:10
may not be looking to buy right now but they're open to it right they're out
16:13
there gathering information because it's on their mind to some degree. Then
16:18
there's a further 20% of the market who are problem aware like they understand
16:23
that they've got a problem. Meaning that they know that they need a new car for
16:28
instance or that they know that they need to lose weight but they aren't
16:31
actively out there researching and on carards on the weekend or researching
16:37
weight loss books or anything stuff like that. So they're not looking to buy.
16:41
And then finally, there's another 60% of the market who aren't problem aware or
16:47
they are not looking to buy. And as I said, like most businesses direct all of
16:52
their marketing efforts and attention on just that 3% that is looking to buy
16:56
right now. And they largely compete on price and are really out there screaming
17:02
like we have got the best range and we have got the cheapest prices or we are
17:07
the best company. Come and buy our stuff, right? We've been in business for
17:12
17 years. You should really come and just buy from us. But the other part of
17:18
the market is like 3,100% larger.
17:25
And there's no additional cost to focus your marketing dollars on that market
17:31
that's 3,000% larger. So, there's a huge opportunity in reaching that 97% of the
17:38
people that are outside of just that top part of the pyramid that are looking to
17:42
buy right now. And and believe it or not, even disinterested prospects can
17:48
turn into lucrative customers if you know how to approach them. So these guys
17:52
that are in the 60%, these can be some of your most lucrative buyers if you
17:57
know the approach and if you know how to take somebody that is not problem aware
18:03
and move them up the pyramid to when they're ready to buy right now.
18:07
And the problem is that most people treat every lead that comes into their
18:12
business like that 3% that are actually ready to buy. And if you look at most
18:17
people's websites, they're all about like the products and services that they
18:22
have or their team and like with a big call to action of either buy now, get in
18:28
touch, speak with our team. And they're all swimming against the raging river of
18:33
mass desires of their market. And it makes no sense. We know the mass market
18:37
desire is information because the statistics show us, right? And instead
18:43
of what you want to do of doing with that, instead of going out there and
18:46
just literally screaming offers to people and asking them to speak with
18:50
your sales team straight out of the gate, what you want to do is you want to
18:55
lead with valuable and educationbased content. Because look, as consultants
19:01
and coaches and service providers of any type, our job is generally centered
19:07
around getting people on the telephone in order to speak with that prospect and
19:12
then convert them into clients. So what we want to do is we want to make sure
19:19
that we have engineered and architectured a situation that maximizes
19:24
that and stacks the deck in our favor. And if we're trying to sell them
19:27
straight out of the gate, we're ignoring the majority of our market. It's as
19:32
simple as that. In fact, now the the crazy thing is that if you look at how
19:39
the online environment works, right, you have a look the average bounce rate for
19:44
a website worldwide, which is simply the amount of people that come to that site
19:49
and then don't go past the first page. It's measured at 47% worldwide. And
19:55
look, some are a little higher, some are a little lower, but on average, you
19:59
know, it's 47% based on a Google Analytics benchmark report. And those
20:04
guys have a lot of data. Um, that means that the other 50% of people who stay
20:10
around on your site, um, and they they're the guys that are kind of
20:14
reading about your company, they're the guys that we call that are actively
20:17
interested in your products and services. Like there's enough on there
20:20
for them to like have a little bit of a read through and see what's going on.
20:24
But as we covered earlier, the average conversion rate of a website is, you
20:27
know, 3%. That's 3% of the 50% who who hung around, you know, at your site and
20:34
your product. So, it's pretty obvious that the big opportunity is really in
20:39
focusing on that 50%. Right? and where the money is being left on the table, so
20:46
to speak, which is really getting more of those people who are actively
20:50
interested in your products and services to buy.
20:53
But how do we do that? Well, let's take it a step further and really break down
20:58
those segments of the market. And let me run you through this model called the
21:02
market sophistication and competition continuum. So what we can see is that
21:08
here that we have a hot market, right? Now, a hot market is pretty
21:13
self-explanatory. It's those people that are really looking to buy right now. And
21:20
it doesn't take a lot of skill really to convince those people to do business
21:24
with you, right? They're like, "I'm really thirsty." And you're like, "I got
21:27
this ice cold glass of water. Would you like it?" They're like, "Yep, awesome.
21:30
Let me take that off you." And then you've got the warm market. and the warm
21:36
market. They're the people that kind of sit in the middle of the pyramid and
21:40
they're like in information gathering mode. So, they're not looking to buy
21:44
right now, but they're certainly open to it. Otherwise, they wouldn't be out
21:47
there getting, you know, collecting all the information. And then you've got the
21:50
cold market, which is really that last segment of the pyramid. And it's that
21:55
whole bottom wedge that really basically makes up the largest opportunity because
22:01
it is just by the sheer amount of prospects that there are in that cold
22:05
unaware market. This is really what shows you the largest opportunity to
22:11
scale. And it's what we call the blue ocean because it's uncontested waters.
22:16
Like people, they don't ever go after that cold market because it's very
22:23
challenging to be able to and it takes a lot of skill to be able to get somebody
22:27
from being completely unaware to then moving them all the way up the pyramid
22:32
to ready to buy right now. And these people are unconsciously aware
22:38
um unconsciously unaware. They don't even know, right, that that they have a
22:42
problem. Um, and then you know there's a small segment of like just on on the
22:47
edge of it that are starting to get consciously aware, right? And like
22:51
there's a very very on the fringe. It's only a very very slither. Um, but this
22:55
is definitely, you know, you look at all businesses that have really scaled up to
22:59
big numbers and it's really their ability to be able to address that
23:04
uncontested blue ocean and cold traffic market and really be skilled enough to
23:12
have a funnel in place that takes somebody from being like a completely
23:17
disengaged wanderer, not knowing that they have a problem, and then moving
23:21
them all the way to the point where they're looking to actually buy it is
23:25
what it is that you've got on offer. Then we've got the next part which is
23:32
really the orange ocean and these are the really the sliver of the the market
23:37
that is in information gathering mode and it's like becoming increasingly
23:41
competitive as there is more noise online and as more businesses move from
23:46
offline marketing into online marketing which we've obviously already seen but
23:51
there's still more and more businesses flooding online every year. It's
23:54
becoming increasingly competitive and the ability to be able to scale in this
24:00
market is very limited and it's because you have to beg for attention, right?
24:05
It's like whoever can scream the loudest and have the most hype and that they're
24:11
the people that really get the biggest share of that market. But because it's
24:17
still only represents a small percentage of the market, the opportunity to scale
24:21
based on that is limited, right? Um, and then the last one is what we call the
24:27
red ocean. And the waters are just bloody with competition. There's blood
24:32
all over the walls. Everybody is just competing on price. And there's really
24:38
stagnant growth in this market. Like you cannot scale a business purely only
24:43
focusing on that very small subset of the market that's looking to buy right
24:47
now. and your your profits are very very small because all you're doing is
24:54
really, you know, competing on features and services and really the price at the
25:00
end of the day. And it's just a it's a small market.
25:03
And so then we look at kind of what what happens and how do you really
25:08
communicate to these people in this market and how do you convert those
25:13
people from being unconsciously unaware to buying right now. Now, in the red
25:20
ocean side of things, in this small buyers market, really, you're just
25:25
telling them about your product and service and price. And this is largely
25:28
how people are doing it, right? They're just talking about their product,
25:30
service, and price, telling everyone how good they are. And that's enough to get
25:34
away with for those people that are already convinced that it is they want
25:38
what it is that you have got on offer. They're just deciding who that they want
25:41
to go with. And then really on like the the orange ocean and the people that are
25:47
increas like the area that's becoming increasingly competitive for these
25:50
people that are out there just kind of in information gathering mode. The way
25:54
that you sell these people is using claims and proof, right? Because they're
25:59
already out there trying to say like, okay, I'm just collecting the
26:03
information to help me solve this problem. And then you just need to claim
26:08
that you can help them solve that problem and then prove it in your
26:12
marketing. Right? And then the last one for the blue ocean which is the
26:16
uncontested waters. The way that you convert these people is you need really
26:22
to use an explanation and storytelling and you need to become a master of
26:26
storytelling. And it takes a lot more effort in order to be able to become
26:33
really effective at those things to be able to convert those people. Right? So
26:39
because they are completely unaware that they have a problem, you have to really
26:44
tell them a story and show them somebody that wasn't aware that they had a
26:48
problem and then show them the transformation that they made and
26:51
explain to them and show them exactly and educate those people of exactly how
26:57
much better that their life could be if they got this problem solved that they
27:01
didn't even know that they had. Okay? And if we just look at the size of the
27:05
opportunity, this is what it looks like. You know, the the blue ocean is the
27:10
biggest segment of that market. And as you move down to the orange ocean, it
27:13
becomes increasingly smaller. And then by the time you get down to the red
27:17
ocean, it's very very minuscule. And you're basically fighting for the scraps
27:22
of that market. So that's basically if you look at, you
27:28
know, all the way from the very very beginning, these people have no sense of
27:32
pain. Then as we move them into the orange
27:36
ocean, they're starting to feel the pain. Okay? And then we move them from
27:40
the information gathering mode, then from the information gathering mode to
27:45
basically the buying mode, they're seeking solutions now to solve that
27:50
pain. And then when you get all the way down into the buying now, they are sold
27:56
that your solution solves their pain. They just want to know if you are the
28:00
best person in order for them to buy off. And this is really, you know, it
28:06
kind of it's a really important thing to look at. And most people don't
28:09
understand. They think that they can just go out there and continually scale
28:13
their business and it's going to be as profitable as it was when they were just
28:17
going on that that red ocean. and it's going to be as easy where they can spend
28:23
a little bit of money, get a few little leads, and then convert those leads at
28:28
the same ease, right? So profit's not the right word. It's more so the effort
28:34
of closing a buying now lead is so much smaller and it's so much easier to do
28:39
than to close somebody that is in completely the unconsciously unaware
28:45
stage. However, the opportunity to do so is just infinitely more exciting. And
28:52
that's really what you need to start to think about. There's a certain cap at
28:55
all of these different ascension points. Like there's a cap on how how big you
28:59
can grow your business focusing completely on the people that are
29:02
looking to buy now. And then there's another barrier and a cap to how fast
29:07
and how big you can grow your business based on the people that are operating
29:10
in that orange ocean. And then really with the blue ocean typically what you
29:16
find that it's almost uncapped that there is almost an endless supply of new
29:24
prospects that are entering into that part of the market every single month,
29:29
every single week, every single day, right? And that's really where you need
29:34
to become a master in if you're trying to scale to eight figures and beyond.
29:39
That's the the area that you need to become a master in. And I'm going to
29:42
show you exactly how to be doing that in this program. Now, as I mentioned for
29:47
before, for the longest time, the sales representative was the gatekeeper of
29:52
information. And the buyer would meet with as many salespeople as possible
29:56
during that information gathering phase. And companies really just relied heavily
30:01
on really great sales reps to bring home the sale through charm and charisma and
30:07
skill. But now B2B buyers are already 57% of the way through their buying
30:14
process before they reach out to a company. Okay. So does that mean that
30:18
salespeople aren't important? Definitely not. I believe that salespeople are
30:23
among the most important people in your whole organization because nothing
30:29
happens until something is sold. And they even become almost more
30:37
important because 92% of all customer interactions now happen over the phone.
30:43
So all it means is that the first step is to provide valuable content upfront
30:50
and then ask for the lead to ultimately get the prospect on the phone. And it's
30:56
really that sequence of events that's important because according to Google,
31:01
71% of buyers start with a generic query, meaning that they are looking for
31:07
a solution to their problems, not your product name or not your company, right?
31:12
They're just starting with something super generic. So that's what we want to
31:17
give them. We want to give them information as because that's what
31:21
they're looking for. And that information that we want to given give
31:24
them is the information that answers their most pressing hair on fire problem
31:30
that they're looking for a solution for because we know that they're looking for
31:35
a solution to their problem but they're really just starting you know on Google
31:39
for instance with a very very very generic querying.
31:44
So how do we know what it is that they are looking for? Like what is it?
31:49
They're starting with a generic query. Well, the way that we do that is by
31:52
looking at all the data that you have already collected, right? And you should
31:57
be reading through that and analyzing it. And that's the reason that I showed
32:02
you exactly my process of how to go out there and really camp out in the mind of
32:08
your dream buyer and find out exactly the questions that they have. What are
32:13
their hopes and dreams, their pains and fears, their barriers and uncertainties?
32:17
What is it that's keeping them up at night unable to sleep in order for them
32:21
to they have to find an answer to this problem that they're experiencing?
32:25
Right? And the reason, you know, you should probably start to see that that's
32:29
so important is because, oh, then we know exactly what they want. And then we
32:34
can just give them exactly what it is that they want. And therefore, our
32:40
conversion rates are going to go up through the roof. And the amount of
32:44
leads that we get is going to go through the roof. And the amount of sales that
32:47
we get is also going to go through the roof because we've gone out there and
32:51
we're able to actually speak to them in the language that they're using. and
32:55
we're able to tell them that we've got the solution to the exact problems that
32:59
they are experiencing. And we are not trying to sell them straight out the
33:03
gate. We're trying to help them answer those questions and give them exactly
33:08
what they want, which is information. So, you might be thinking, well, how do
33:13
I give them that information? Like, what does it look like? Well, we use
33:16
something that I call a high value content offer. And basically what we do
33:23
is we we put together a high-value content offer. And you know a high-value
33:27
content offer is essentially a piece of information that is of high value. So a
33:32
free report, PDF, video trainings, a webinar, cheat sheets, and swipe files.
33:38
It's basically like an ethical bribe that you offer people in exchange for
33:43
their email address. And the best type of high-v value content offer in my
33:47
opinion is just a down and dirty free report or a PDF because there's very
33:52
little commitment for the enduser and it's very clear on what it is that
33:57
they're getting. There's like a mental picture that they can wrap their brain
34:00
around and it solves an immediate need. And it also gives them instant
34:04
gratification. You know, they can get it and they can just read it very quickly
34:08
and away they go. And all of that, right? On top of that, you're also able
34:16
to build your list as aggressively as possible. And what do I mean by that? I
34:21
mean your list of prospects who are raising their hand in a sea of people
34:25
and saying like, "Yo, yo, I'm interested in what it is that you've got." Like,
34:28
you're not going to be downloading a free report on how to reduce, you know,
34:32
your repayments on your mortgage unless you were in the market for that. And
34:36
I've never seen anything that allows you to build your list of prospects as
34:42
aggressively as a free report. As the cost per lead for free reports is always
34:46
the lowest. Like you can't beat the cost per lead on one of these things. Now,
34:51
you've probably heard of these before or some people refer to them as lead
34:54
magnets or white papers or whatever you want to call them, right? The reality is
34:58
that these things have been around for more than a hundred years and a lot of
35:03
people have tried them and very very few people can ever get them to work. And
35:09
that's because they have no idea on how to effectively craft one that is
35:15
completely irresistible for their dream buyer. And then they don't know what to
35:19
do once they've actually captured that prospect's details. Right? You don't
35:24
just get them a free report and then they just, you know, start banging down
35:28
your door, waving their credit card, being like, "I'm ready to buy some
35:31
shit." That's not how it works, right? And I'm going to be walking you through
35:34
in forensic detail of exactly how to craft the most killer high-value content
35:42
offer that really just sucks in leads like a vacuum cleaner on steroids in the
35:47
next module. And I have spent, you know, tens of millions of dollars
35:54
advertising highv value content offers in more than 416
35:59
different niches and markets. And I've split tested these things to the high
36:04
heavens. And I'm going to be showing you everything that I know and all the scars
36:08
that I have collected from the years and finding out all the little tweaks of
36:12
what works and what doesn't work. And we're going to be covering that in the
36:16
coming modules. For now, I want to talk about terrorizing the competition. Now,
36:22
let me tell you why this strategy is so brutally effective and how it completely
36:27
allows you to just terrorize your competition and really leave them in a
36:33
state of complete oppression where they are down on their knees pleading for
36:38
mercy. Right? And I know that's strong language, but this is a really really
36:43
ninja strategy. And I want to show you how I've used this singlehandedly to
36:48
enter into hyperco competitive markets, right? Where the waters were bloody with
36:54
competition and just dismantle much larger competitors that were just much
36:59
more established and really build the number one fastest growing business in
37:03
my industry and the 28th fastest growing company in the whole of the country
37:09
ranked by the Australian Financial Review. You see, all of your competitors
37:14
are trying to sell those people straight out the gate on their websites, i.e. get
37:18
in touch, contact my team, get a free quote, get an express quote, speak with
37:23
our sales team. And they are just ignoring the 97% of the market and you
37:30
can just come in by night and literally start addressing the majority of the
37:35
total buyers in that market that everybody else is ignoring. And this
37:41
really allows you to start up a dialogue. And what's really important
37:46
about starting up that dialogue is it allows you to set the buying criteria.
37:53
This is seriously profound and powerful. Probably one of the most powerful things
37:58
that I've ever come across. And it is like a stealth strategy where your
38:03
competitors will really have no idea what you're up to until it's too late.
38:08
and you just come in by night and you take all the customers and they wake up
38:12
and they're like, "Well, where the hell did that dude come from?" Like, I've
38:17
been operating this business for 10 years and they just came in and all of a
38:21
sudden now like they're just everywhere. They keep on coming up in all of our
38:25
sales phone calls. Like, everyone's talking about these people. Like, what
38:29
the hell is going on here? And they have no idea what's going on, right? And the
38:34
reason is is because you're the one who has their name and email address of the
38:40
prospects and their competitors don't. So then you can start to nurture this
38:45
audience and actually set the buying criteria. Right? So as we looked before
38:49
at the market sophistication and competition continuum like everyone's
38:54
only addressing that red ocean and no one is addressing this other 97% of the
38:58
market. And because we come in and we address them, then we can start to
39:02
dictate what the buying criteria is of that whole marketplace. Because we're
39:07
the only one that has their name and email address. We're the only people
39:10
that are communicating with these people. No one else is because no one
39:14
else is focusing on them. And you know, we can tell them about what's important
39:19
and what's not. We can tell them about what to look out for. We can show them
39:24
where the value is in a solution to help them solve this problem. And we can
39:29
really tell them what they should be doing to solve that problem. And then
39:33
you become the educator, right? You become that educator that is providing
39:38
valuable and like valuable information. And this establishes you as the number
39:42
one authority in your marketplace. and the people that your prospects look
39:48
up to and they trust as this person that's got their best interest at heart
39:52
because they know nothing else about any of your competitors because they're all
39:57
just competing in those blood drenched waters of the market that is looking to
40:01
buy right now. And they're alongside hundreds and hundreds of other lazy
40:06
competitors who are all fighting each other like rats in a maze for this small
40:12
small piece of cheese. and they're screaming offers to these prospects like
40:16
get a quote, right? Or offering them some threatening call to action from a
40:22
salesperson where they can't even find out anything more without getting an
40:26
express quote or a free consultation or without speaking to a sales rep, which
40:32
is whether you like it or not is a threatening thing. It's a lot more
40:36
threatening than just downloading a free report that includes a lot of
40:40
information that's going to help that person. And you're here building trust
40:44
and a relationship with that huge segment of the market that is infinitely
40:49
bigger and then providing value before you're ever asking for anything, right?
40:56
And you're moving them closer to a decision and you're building goodwill
41:00
which no one else in your marketplace is doing. And this is seriously one of the
41:05
most powerful insights because it allows you to set the buying criteria of your
41:10
market, which is the criteria that a transaction takes place. And
41:14
essentially, you're controlling the flow of information and then telling them
41:19
what they should value and what is important. And by the time that you move
41:25
people down to that buying now stage, right, you're the only one that they
41:31
will listen to because skepticism in today's day and age is just rampant,
41:38
right? I don't believe that there's ever been a harder time in history to get
41:43
people to buy from you the first time. And I'm sure that once you've done the
41:48
Halo strategy in your market, you will see this firsthand. Like people are
41:53
freaking terrified to make the wrong decision of being ripped off. Like you
41:58
will see that same research coming up when you do the Halo strategy in your
42:02
market. That was like that's is people's number one concern is that they're going
42:06
to make the wrong decision and they're going to get ripped off. And there are
42:10
gurus in every corner of the internet promising your prospects a solution to
42:17
their problem. Right? And the reality of it is that they have probably already
42:23
tried to solve that problem with somebody else and they haven't been able
42:30
to solve that. It's fallen short for some reason. And really, if you look at
42:35
that, well, that's exactly why skepticism is so rampant because people
42:41
don't want to make the wrong decision. And the most compelling way to prove to
42:46
your prospects that you can help them, right, is by actually helping them
42:51
before you ever ask for anything in return. That is the only way to overcome
42:56
this skepticism. And I'll be teaching you step by step
43:01
this process of exactly how to do that in this in this program, right? and
43:07
giving you the system to deploy in your market word for word plugandplay with
43:12
everything that you need. And it's really the process of taking your
43:16
prospects from Tinder to Netflix and chill. Taking someone completely cold,
43:22
completely unaware that they have a problem and then, you know, educating
43:26
them all the way down to that they're ready to make a buying decision, right?
43:31
And that is really that process of taking someone that's on on Tinder
43:36
that's looking for some fast hot action to taking them all the way down to we're
43:40
ready to chill out, start a relationship with you. So I'm going to be showing you
43:43
I'm going to be giving you the system of exactly how to do that later on in the
43:47
program. So really the resources though for for this module is you need to be
43:52
looking at your halo strategy. This is something that you will be referring to,
43:56
right? You need to look at it. You need to read it. It needs to be something
44:00
that is mentally burnt into your brain. So your dream buyer, their avatar
44:06
becomes somebody that you know intimately like like a friend or a
44:10
family member or a spouse, you know them that well, right? That's the things that
44:15
you want to be referring to. And the action items for this module is first to
44:20
go through the Halo strategy worksheet and really identify the number one hair
44:26
on fire problem, right? like look for that one thing that just keeps on coming
44:33
up from your research and then basically from reading that Halo strategy
44:38
worksheet is how you're going to be able to do that and just obsessing over it
44:41
and really thinking about it, putting yourself in the shoes of that dream
44:44
buyer and really finding out what that number one hair on fire problem or
44:50
question is that they've got that you could offer them an immediate solution
44:55
to that hair on fire problem or question in your highv value content offer.
45:01
You want to study your dream buyer avatar worksheet and really figure out
45:05
what's important to them, right? You know these people intimately. You know
45:10
their age. You know how much money they um earn. You know their interests. You
45:15
know where they live. You know what a typical day looks like for them. And
45:18
it's something that you really need to study in order to start thinking about,
45:22
you know, your highv value content offer. And then you want to identify any
45:28
competitors in your market that is using some form of highv value content offer,
45:33
right? And you want to have a look and see like are they all just leading with
45:38
a really threatening get a quote speak with our team which look 99% of them
45:43
will be. But if there are some people that have half a brain and they are
45:47
running you know a high value content offer have a look at that. Put that in
45:52
your swipe file. download it, read the emails that they send you, get some
45:57
value out of it, see what's going on and and how they're presenting it and and
46:02
try to look for those clues and see if this is actually successful, if this is
46:06
you'll know from your research, right, by looking at your Halo strategy
46:10
worksheet if their highv value content offer is addressing what the number one
46:15
hair on fire problem is. So, that brings us to the end of this
46:20
module. Go ahead, do this stuff now and I will see you in the next video.

HVCO Formula:


Timeless Cut-And-Paste HVCO Formulas


The internet is a noisy and chaotic place. Your prospects are being bombarded with
distraction. There is a war for attention. And attention is the currency of the internet.
Nothing else matters if you’re unable to gain the attention of your market. Do not water
down your copy. That is your HVCO title.
Instead imagine your prospect is big, fat and lazy...And they’re half asleep on the
couch...And in order for them to get your HVCO, you must motivate them to walk
outside in a snowstorm to get it. How much intrigue and benefits would need to be
promised in order to achieve this. That’s where we’re operating from. That place.


Timeless Formula #1
X ways to achieve [Desirable Thing] without doing [Undesirable Thing]
Example: 6 Ways to Get Washboard Abs Without Doing a Single Sit-Up
Timeless Formula #2
[Do Difficult Thing] in [Specific Period of Time] Even if [Shortcomings]
Example: Pay Off Your Mortgage in 7 Years Even if You Have a Modest Income
Timeless Formula #3
Achieve [Desirable Thing] like [An Expert] Even Without [Something Expected]
Example: Paint Masterpieces Like Picasso Without Ever Having a Single Lesson!
Timeless Formula #4
How to Eliminate [Biggest Problem] without doing [The Thing They Hate] Within
[Specific Timeframe]
Example: How to Eliminate Your Muffin Top Without Giving Up the Foods You Love –
Within 21 Days or Less!
These are all pretty good starting points for your HVCO title. They speak to your
prospect’s needs in a clear and concise way.

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time you write a new report. However, if
you can come up with a unique and memorable title, it will suck in leads like a vacuum
cleaner on steroids.


Action Points
● Using the data you uncovered by using The Halo Strategy, brainstorm a HVCO
you can produce to answer the questions keeping your ideal customer up at
night.
● Choose your best idea and create a solid HVCO (a free report, video or cheat
sheet, etc.) that gets your dream buyer to raise their hands and identify
themselves as being interested in what you’re selling. The content and title of
this HVCO should address the #1 most common ‘hair-on-fire’ question or
concern your market is having and that kept coming up from your research.
The HVCO should be positioned to solve that problem or answer that question.
● Ensure your copy contains a bold headline and a strong call to action.
● Speak to your audience in the same language as the questions they’re asking.
● Don’t be afraid to directly address how your products and services fill the gap.
When you connect with your audience this way, you’ll resonate on a far more
influential level. In fact, your customers will feel as if your products or services are
tailored specifically for their exact needs and desires, making this the most effective
way to grow your business.




Transcript 1.6 
Hey guys, Subri Subie here and welcome to this module of Quantum Growth called
0:15
Giving Your Market Crack. And you're probably thinking, what the hell is Sri
0:20
talking about now? Well, in this module, I'm really going to be diving right in
0:26
and actually showing you step by step how to generate literally thousands of
0:32
thousands of leads per month. And it all starts with giving your market crack.
0:37
What exactly do I mean by that? I'll get to that in just a moment, but for now,
0:41
let me just show you what we'll be covering in this module. So, we're going
0:44
to be covering the currency of the internet, giving your market crack, the
0:48
economics of the larger market formula, and creating a lethally potent high
0:54
value content offer. So, first things first, the currency of the internet,
1:01
right? We already know that the internet is where, you know, the majority of
1:05
people are spending their time. You know, like six plus hours per day is
1:09
spent online. And really, you think about, okay, we know they're online. So,
1:15
what is the environment? Well, it is an environment that is a chaotic blizzard
1:22
of noise and distraction. And really, the currency of the internet is
1:29
attention. Because everything starts with getting attention. If you don't
1:33
have a proven way to grab your market's attention, then you're really dead,
1:39
right? uh you need to be able to grab their attention and then articulate how
1:42
you can help them solve their problems. And if you don't have those pieces in
1:46
place, then you're finished. You're dead on arrival. There's nothing that's going
1:49
to happen because you're not going to have a business. You're not going to
1:52
have customers if you don't know how to get your prospects attention to then
1:55
turn them into clients. You see, before you speak to them, quote them, or enroll
2:01
them as clients and customers, you've got to first get their attention. And
2:05
this is seriously, you know, an critically important element because if
2:09
you can't get their attention, then they don't know you exist and then you'll
2:13
never even get started. And the battlefield for attention right
2:18
now is downright insane. Okay, there is just so much going on. There is so much
2:27
noise. And here are the two truths about modern marketing that you should really
2:32
think deeply about, right? And that is that one, people are constantly
2:38
distracted and overwhelmed. There is just so many things vying for
2:44
their attention that it's impossible almost to grab them by the jugular and
2:50
drag them to what it is that you want to focus their attention on. This is just
2:54
like, you know, just some of the noise that you can see up on the screen of
2:58
like banner ads online and just all the chaos and all the marketing messages
3:02
that people are exposed to on a daily basis. And the second thing is that
3:07
people have built up a tremendous resistance to advertising and are highly
3:15
highly skeptical, right? And that's just because they're bombarded by so many
3:19
things and there's so many people constantly screaming offers at them. So
3:23
to wake your prospects up and to focus them on your offers, there are two
3:28
things that you must do. And the first thing is that you one must be dramatic
3:33
in your advertising. Like a lot of the time when people see my marketing or
3:39
even you know when they see direct response marketing they're like wow like
3:43
this is very intense and it's very dramatic. And that's because it has to
3:47
be. Otherwise, you're never even going to get attention because you are
3:52
competing with just that sea of noise and offers and ads and advertising and
3:58
all these distractions bombarding your prospect from every single angle. It's
4:02
like if you were in in in a room that is like a live rock concert and there's
4:07
people screaming on stage and you're in the corner whispering. Do you think
4:11
you're going to get any attention? No. Well, that's what most people's
4:14
advertising is doing. It's just whispering in a corner, right? And now
4:17
the second thing is you mustn't make your advertising look like advertising.
4:23
And we're going to be diving exactly just how to do that in great detail
4:27
throughout this program. But if you don't do those two things, right, you
4:32
won't cut through the mental fog, sales resistance, and the clutter of
4:36
advertising messages that are begging for your prospect's attention every
4:40
single day, every minute of every day, really. So the way that you do that is
4:45
you focus on being different, unusual, and as dramatic as possible. And if you
4:52
can do that and do effective well, then like your business is going to just grow
4:57
geometrically. And in order to do that, in order to get attention, in order to
5:02
be different, unusual, and dramatic, you really need to understand what is the
5:08
environment that all of our prospects are in every day. the places that they
5:13
are going for entertainment. You know, what are the things that they're doing
5:19
and where where are they going not just for business but where are they going
5:22
for leisure? Because you need to intimately understand these people and
5:25
you need to understand the environment in which your offers and your ads are
5:32
going to be battling for attention. So you must like know like what are the the
5:37
most popular shows on Netflix? What is this undercurrent? And really you must
5:42
become a student of markets. And this is something that is profoundly important.
5:49
Okay? You must be connected and tuned in to the heartbeat of society. Even if
5:55
you, you know, you don't agree with it. Even if you don't like some of the shows
6:00
or the clickbait or all the stuff that's going on, you must be aware of it. You
6:03
can't operate being oblivious to exactly what's happening in markets. And it's
6:08
not about just your market. you must understand and become a student
6:13
of multiple markets and multiple you know that's the way that you really
6:18
build you know a repertoire and build an understanding of exactly how to become a
6:23
brilliant marketer so you know some of the ways that you do that is by looking
6:28
at like what are the most popular TV series of 2019 or 2020 or whenever it is
6:35
right you just need to look and go okay these these are the most popular like
6:39
this is what people are finding entertaining, right? And you must know
6:43
because ultimately, you know, we're trying to be dramatic and we're trying
6:48
to stand out and the only way that you stand out is by either speaking to
6:54
people in the language that they're already used to and you know the
6:57
environment that they operate in or doing something dramatically different.
6:59
And the only way that you can do that is by knowing the sea of chaos that you're
7:04
going to be competing in. looking at the most wished for products on Amazon. You
7:10
can break it down by a category. Have a look. See what people are wishing that
7:13
they could buy. Understand like what is it that's motivating people? Like it's
7:18
crazy to see that the most wished for electronic item um you know for the year
7:24
was the Fire TV Stick 4K with Alexa voice remote. Right? It just shows you
7:28
like where people are shifting to what's happening. Right? Look at these. like
7:34
there's a huge huge trend with people being able to want to talk to their te
7:37
their electronic products and their you know electronics. They're the top two
7:42
products on there. And it's just like just seeing, okay, this is what's
7:45
changing, convenience, right? Or looking at the most viewed websites in the
7:52
world, you know, and having a look at the country that's occupying those.
7:56
Google, number one most viewed website in the world, YouTube, Facebook, Bo,
8:02
Wikipedia, Tencent, Toba, Teemo, Yahoo, Amazon, Twitter. you know,
8:07
understanding, okay, this is this is what's going on.
8:11
This is what's happening. These are the websites that people are visiting to the
8:15
most and spending the most time on. Because if you can see something on here
8:19
and go, okay, like people are spending the most amount of time on Google,
8:23
YouTube, and Facebook. Where do you think that you should be going to get
8:27
customers? Where they're all hanging out, right? Absolute 101 in marketing.
8:33
Um, and then you can go down that list and look at emerging, you know, Reddit.
8:37
Reddit offers ads. Do you know what I mean? If you've tapped out the other ad
8:40
channels, can you look to those? Um, you know, Amazon, all these different
8:44
things. And there's only by looking at these and really having your finger on
8:48
the pulse of what's going on in a market, as people, as a human race, can
8:55
you start to really understand these things.
8:59
Um or you look at this like Reddit look at the average like even though it's the
9:03
most not the most popular it's the fifth most popular um in the US and look at
9:07
this 10 minutes on average higher than any other website in the top 10
9:13
um or the most viewed videos you know over the last 10 years or 5 years or
9:18
seven years like look at Gangum Style like how long it took to hit 3 billion
9:22
views look at Despacito right these are just interesting things for you to look
9:28
at and Okay. Like this is what's going on. Like this is the rate and the speed
9:33
in which technology is breaking down barriers and allowing things to go viral
9:38
very very quickly. And these are the things that people are enjoying. And
9:42
it's not that you're going to be selling anything to do with Gangum style or
9:45
despacto. It's about being a student of markets and a student of people. Looking
9:51
at the most searched and most asked questions in your market as we covered
9:55
before. Um then also seeing like what is the the
9:59
the most trending content for that year, right? What was trending the most
10:03
globally and having a look at like the the thing that was dominating everything
10:08
was the World Cup and then Avichi and then Mac Miller and Stanley and just
10:12
looking at these things and the royal family having a look at what's going on
10:16
from searches to news to people, you know, to athletes and actors,
10:24
all of that stuff. It's just it's very important and it cannot be like you know
10:29
undervalued is really understanding this stuff and really knowing what's going on
10:35
because it's really the fabric that makes up society right now. I don't know
10:41
you know how many of you read trending content on Reddit or Buzzfeed or
10:46
Facebook. I don't know how many of you go to every film that makes $100 million
10:51
and see, you know, every one of them or check out the most popular shows on
10:56
Netflix. But you cannot lose touch with the people of this country of the people
11:02
of the country that you operate in, right? or of the the entire human race.
11:08
No matter how successful or you know how how potent you think you are in terms of
11:14
your marketing skill, if you don't spend at least 2 hours a week finding out
11:19
where your market is today, you are already dead. You will have, you know, a
11:25
career or a business of three blazing years and you'll be finished. But in
11:30
order to be somebody that has longevity in the game, you need to know the fabric
11:36
of society, whether you like it or not. You must become a student of people and
11:43
of markets. So now what I've got is a little video for you that Google put
11:47
together that essentially aggregates all of the data from all of their different
11:51
assets that they've got online and just shows you like a year in review of the
11:56
things that were the most riveting that moved nations that went the most viral.
12:01
So let me just roll this video for you now.
12:04
It takes a few seconds. So I'll switch this one on.
12:07
I'll switch this one on and we'll just see if mommy talks.
12:10
Alex. Alex. Alex.
12:15
Alex. Alex.
12:17
Hello. You. This is a miracle rescue that all 13
12:22
members of the soccer team are out of the cave.
12:25
He turns into the superhero set on feeding as many homeless people as
12:29
possible. This election, we've seen historic voter
12:32
turnout. An all Asian cast. There's nothing more
12:35
empowering. You have to go right up into it.
12:48
It'll be all right. The music
12:57
in the outfield will
13:05
I was saying the word yani. And however difficult life may seem, while there's
13:11
life, there is hope. Kids have the dream. They just want to
13:16
know that someone cares. We got love for you. It's only right. We
13:19
got to stick together. like that.
13:34
Washington, our champions. Welcome to the show,
13:39
Chloe. I love you so much.
13:46
Life is good. The world is filled with people doing the best they can. you
13:51
know, who love their kids and would like to live their lives with a little
13:54
dignity and hope just like everybody else.
14:06
So, the reason that I wanted to show you that is because I see marketers and
14:11
business owners all the time obsess over the things that change constantly like
14:16
the latest Facebook ads targeting strategy or the latest chatbot
14:20
integration or automation software or this special kind of funnel, but they
14:25
don't obsess over the things that don't change. Look, people don't change.
14:33
Technology changes, right? So, you really want to become a student of
14:37
people and of human behavior and find out the things that are emotionally
14:42
riveting, the things that persuade people, the things that aren't going to
14:47
change with just like the wind direction, like the latest advertising
14:52
channel. You really, really need to become a student of people and of
14:57
markets. And this is something that if you want to transition to where you are
15:01
right now to just a ruthlessly effective business builder, this is something that
15:06
you must commit to. So now let's move on to giving your
15:11
market crack. And this is really about giving them exactly what it is that
15:18
their brain is wired to want. And that just shoots a dopamine release in their
15:23
brain and floods their brain with chemicals. and not to go against the
15:27
raging river, but just give them what they want, right? And the way that you
15:32
do that is by really thinking about looking at your your Halo strategy
15:37
worksheet and finding out exactly what it is that your market does want. You
15:42
know that because you've gone through that and you can see all the questions
15:45
that they want the most. And then we want to basically wrap that up in our
15:50
high value content offer. Now, I'm going to show you how to create a potent
15:56
potent high-value content offer that sucks in leads like a vacuum cleaner on
16:00
steroids with the insights that you've already gotten from your Halo strategy
16:05
worksheet. And so then your next move is to use that information and and
16:11
basically create a piece of the most irresistible bait for your dream vi
16:16
dream buyer, right? And the types of contents, as I said, that we do that
16:20
with is free reports, video trainings, webinars, cheat sheets, and swipe files.
16:26
And you know, for you in the beginning, this is definitely the place that you
16:30
want to start. In my opinion, it's still the most effective way is by creating
16:36
just a free report, just a down and dirty PDF. Um, it's easy to do. It
16:41
doesn't need to be like your magnum opus, your life's work. It can be just a
16:45
simple 5 to 10page free report. And the reason that I believe that they're so
16:50
effective is just because it's very very clear of exactly what your prospect is
16:56
getting in exchange for giving you their name and email address. And it solves
17:00
that immediate need. And it also gives them the instant gratification that
17:04
they're looking for. Now, on top of all of that, you know, the big benefit of it
17:09
is that if you're, you know, advertising a highv value content offer, being a
17:14
free report on something like Google or Facebook, it's the way that you're going
17:19
to be able to aggressively grow your list of prospects, i.e. people that are
17:23
interested in what it is that you are selling for the cheapest price and the
17:27
most aggressive way possible. So now these are just some, you know,
17:33
examples of highv value content offers, right? Um, so you can see on here, you
17:42
know, they've all kind of got the use of numbers on here. It's all very
17:45
straightforward. You know what you're going to kind of be getting as a result
17:48
of this. Now, as I said, you've probably heard of these before and people calling
17:52
them all types of things of like league magnets or white papers. Um, but as I
17:57
mentioned earlier on that these have been around for hundreds of years and
18:03
like a lot of people know about them, but they just really don't know how to
18:09
make them work. Like they've tried them. They've like, "Oh, I tried to do a free
18:13
report and you know, my business wasn't just flooded with clients and money."
18:18
And that's because there's lots of people out there that are trying to
18:22
deploy them and aren't doing them the correct way. But really, what I'm going
18:28
to be showing you is how to grab eyeballs online and then convert them.
18:34
And right now, I'm going to walk you through step by step of exactly how to
18:38
do this with templates and all. And as I discussed in an earlier module, the the
18:43
larger market formula. strategy is incredibly powerful because it allows
18:47
you to speak to just a much larger segment of the market and really bring
18:51
in an infinitely amount more of leads coming into your business. And not only
18:56
that, but you're also leading with value to your marketplace. And you're not just
19:01
making a straight up offer to them right out the gate and asking for the marriage
19:05
proposal before you you've taken them out for a drink or you've gone and had
19:10
dinner together or whatever it might be. Then like your prospects will have more
19:17
information once they download, you know, your free report. And then that
19:22
the logical progression for that is to move them up the pyramid from just the
19:25
research phase into the buying phase. And this allows you to generate hundreds
19:29
of leads if not thousands of leads while positioning yourself as just that
19:34
trusted authority in your marketplace cuz you're the only one providing that
19:38
information. But before we dive into the exact specifics of, you know, how to
19:44
create them, let me quickly just show you how many more leads that this allows
19:49
you to generate, you know, for the same amount of ad spend.
19:54
So, take a look at this slide, right? You got a 100 visitors that come
19:57
through. Now, from these 100 visitors, we're going to be pushing these
20:02
prospects to a page that has an offer on there that is, you know, get a free
20:09
quote, right? And the average landing page like this converts at 4%. As we
20:14
covered, right now, this would basically give you, you know, four leads. And from
20:20
those four leads that you get, you see on average that you're assuming a 25%
20:26
close rate of these leads, right? then you'll end up with one sale if you're
20:30
able to do this. Okay, so that's not bad, right? That's not a hugely bad
20:35
outcome depending on how much you paid to get those 100 visitors.
20:40
Now, we're going to take another scenario where we also have a 100
20:44
people, right? And from these 100 people, we send them through to a
20:49
landing page. But instead of just trying to sell them some stuff straight out the
20:54
gate and going with a very threatening offer like speaking to a sales team,
20:58
we're going to offer them a free report. And because of that, we're going to get
21:02
a conversion rate of upwards of 30%. Like they can convert a lot higher than
21:08
that, but we'll just say 30%. Right? And basically that's because we're offering
21:14
value straight up. We're not trying to sell them. We're not having this
21:18
threatening thing, this threatening thing come to them. We're just offering
21:22
them that crack that they want, that immediate press a button solution to the
21:28
problem or the questions that they're experiencing right now. Right? So from
21:32
that same 100 visitors, we've got a 30% conversion rate. meaning that we will
21:37
get you know from that 30 leads and from those 30 leads we're going to have a 10%
21:43
close rate. Now because these leads are going to be you know at various stages
21:49
of awareness. So we need to be real realistic and assume that the conversion
21:54
rate is going to drop substantially right it might even be less than 10%. It
22:00
might be higher it all depends on what your market is. Um, but you know, even
22:04
if this happens and it's a 10% drop and it goes down to a 10% conversion rate
22:09
for them, instead of getting one sale, we're going to get three sales. And our
22:15
sales have increased by 300%. Just from switching this lead genen
22:22
model and going instead of going with a a get a quote and speak with our team to
22:26
going with a free report and something of value, right? And this is the power
22:31
of a potent high-value content offer. Not only does it give value to your
22:35
prospects and create goodwill and establish you as that real authority in
22:40
your space, but it's also just way more efficient and way more profitable,
22:45
right? And this is just like, you know, a hypothetical example. So let let's
22:49
have a look at some real examples, right? So this is for a client. We spent
22:54
$7,728. We generated 668 leads at $1157
23:03
a pop. Do you know what I mean? Like that's people that are leads, hot leads
23:09
for that market, right? And that's an insane result. Then we got another one.
23:15
We spent $6,226 in this instance.
23:20
We generated $1,934 leads at a tiny $322 per lead. Like, if
23:29
you could go out there and generate thousands of leads for a couple of
23:33
dollars a pop, do you think that you're going to have any problem going and
23:36
actually getting customers, you know, and a and having more customers than you
23:40
know what to do with? I can tell you right now that if you follow all the
23:45
steps that I'm talking about in this program and you actually do the work
23:50
that like you know this is the possibility that you're looking at is
23:52
having thousands and thousands of leads come into your business you know and
23:57
only costing you a couple of dollars a pop
24:00
or they were from Facebook ads those examples. Let's have a look at one from
24:04
Google. So, in this instance on Google, we spent $8,310
24:09
and we generated $2,330 leads costing us a tiny $353 a lead.
24:17
Like, it doesn't really matter what the channel is. Like, this strategy, it just
24:23
works, right? Here's another example from Facebook. We spent $8,834.
24:29
We generated 3,589 leads at just $246
24:37
per lead. And you might be thinking, well, yeah, but that's just a free
24:42
report, Subbury. Like, what do you do with those leads? Well, I'm going to
24:45
show you what to what you do with those leads. But basically, the result of
24:49
getting like thousands and thousands of leads at just a couple of dollars a pop
24:53
is this. This is what ends up happening when you have thousands and thousands of
24:58
people entering into the top of your funnel that you know you're going to get
25:02
bookings on your calendar of people waiting and eager to speak to you about
25:09
you helping them solve this problem that they've got. Right? And this is just
25:14
for, you know, for for one person. And then if you look at here's another
25:18
example of when you actually have a sales team and and filling up multiple
25:23
calendars of just people and then it's not just like you know people that are
25:27
looking for information either like look at this quote from Adam like a closed
25:32
two deals um one that's valued at 22K another one that's valued at 18k um
25:38
using like the script that we're going to be covering in for converting these
25:42
appointments into paying clients right So, but that's not all. There's also
25:49
another reason why they are so powerful. Now, what you're starting to see on all
25:54
these different advertising channels is that it's becoming incredibly difficult
25:59
to be able to write compelling copy because all these compliance reasons.
26:04
There's all these things that you can say and you can't say on Facebook and
26:08
Google right now. And they're just eradicating advertising accounts based
26:12
on people breaking their policies. And you might be thinking, well, I'm not
26:15
selling anything sinister, Sbury. Like, this is not going to really affect me.
26:19
This affects everybody because even like they don't want you using the word like
26:24
you or your like it's ridiculous the level of scrutiny that they're placing
26:29
on advertisers right now. And the reason that it's so effective is because you
26:34
can say very little and compel somebody to download a free report and give you
26:40
their name and their email address in exchange for that. is there's not a huge
26:44
amount of hoo-ha that you need to do in order to get somebody to be willing to
26:48
do that, right? It's a free piece of content. Then once you've got that email
26:52
and that name, you know that that person has raised their hands in a sea of
26:56
people as being someone that's interested in what it is that you're
26:59
doing. Then there's no like you can say whatever you want over email and
27:03
communicate with those people um you know over email and other forms of
27:08
following up that we'll be going through where you can make claims. You can use
27:13
really good motivating and persuasive copy and you're not at the mercy of
27:19
those advertising channels. And this is something that no one talks about, but
27:23
you know, it's a highlevel strategy that what one of the reasons that it is so
27:28
incredibly effective is because it allows you to have that communication
27:32
with them and not have your hands tied behind your back of what you can say and
27:36
what you can't say. So, let me ask you, right, if you were able to generate
27:42
thousands of leads every single month for just a couple of dollars each, what
27:48
would that mean for your business? looking at how much your average client
27:52
is worth to your business and how many of these leads that you would actually
27:55
have to convert into paying clients in order for that whole exercise to be
28:01
highly profitable for you. Right? So basically enough of that. I just wanted
28:07
to leave that thought with you and just think about like what I've just walked
28:10
through this walked you through like don't just think this is kind of cool.
28:14
Think about the profound impact that this can have on your business if you
28:19
execute this. All right, but enough of that. Let's dive into the actual nuts
28:23
and bolts and the actual brass tax of how we do this. So, this is exactly how
28:30
to create a lethally potent high value content offer that is really positioned
28:37
to really just flood your prospect's brain full of dopamine and really get
28:42
them wired up and create so much intrigue that they have to just take
28:47
action. And the number one rule is really to grab them by the throat with
28:53
an attentiongrabbing headline. And what I mean by that is is
28:58
really just turn up the volume of your copy. Like I see so many times that like
29:06
when people are trying to use like a free report to get leads, like they just
29:09
give it this like lackluster shitty vanilla title and they expect people
29:14
just to trip over themselves to want to download it and it's ridiculous, right?
29:18
You need to turn the volume up. You need to give them that crack. Your headline
29:22
must have teeth. It must bite. And a lot of people that read my copy, they might
29:27
feel like, "Wow, this is like a shot of Red Bull or like an adrenaline or crack
29:31
cocaine." And that's because like the internet is a really noisy place and
29:36
people have like ADD. And my dream prospects are like sleepwalking through
29:42
a fog of gurus screaming offers at them. and my cop copy, it needs to just shoot
29:49
like an electric bolt through their body and demand their attention. You know, it
29:54
really must wake them up. And in order to do that, I need to turn that volume
29:58
up. I need to grab their attention. I'm competing with all that crazy chaos, you
30:03
know, that's like Kim Kardashian and all this stuff that's gone viral and Trump
30:08
and China and all this crazy stuff that's going on. I can't go in there and
30:11
whisper in the back of that rock concert and expect to get any attention. I must
30:16
demand attention. Right now to illustrate the importance and the power
30:20
of this, let me share a story with you. Right? So in 1982,
30:26
Norah Hayden released a book called Astrological Love. And like looking at
30:31
the title of this book, what you can see here, like what is it that you think
30:35
this book is about? Does it grab you? Does it demand your
30:39
attention? Is it really clear? And is it specific as to like what you would learn
30:46
if you bought this book? If you were in a busy airport and rushing through like
30:50
what is it that you if you took a glance at this book? What is it about?
30:55
Well, when they print a book, right? And I know this cuz I've just gone through
31:00
this process. The first print run is typically around 5,000 books. And most
31:04
books don't sell out of their first print run. It's like something crazy.
31:08
Like 80 or 90% of books never sell out of their first print run. And this all
31:13
this book also didn't sell out of its initial print run of the 5,000 books. In
31:17
fact, it only sold something like 2,000 copies.
31:21
So Hayden sold the rest of the book, like the other 3,000 books, you know,
31:25
that she had to like discount bookstores and flea markets who sell books for like
31:29
99. And it was there that a New York publisher stumbled across the book and
31:34
bought it. And then they read it and they thought like this is like a really
31:39
great book on on how to seduce women. And then they called Norah Hayden and
31:44
they bought the rights to the book and they republished it. And they didn't
31:49
change a word inside the book, right? Exactly the same book. The product was
31:56
exactly the same. But he did change the title of the book
32:01
and he changed it to how to satisfy a woman every time and have her beg for
32:07
more. Which book would you rather read if you were in the market for this kind
32:12
of thing, right? Which book clearly articulates exactly what you're going to
32:18
get? Look at the subhead sub headline. The first and only book that tells you
32:23
exactly how. Well, the result was 2.5 million book sales in 18 months. It
32:31
became a massive cultural phenomenon. A New York Times bestseller, number one
32:36
bestseller, same book, same content, just a different title. And it wasn't
32:41
the picture on the cover that made the difference because like if you look at
32:45
there are actually no pictures. It was the title and more specifically the
32:51
offer in the title that changed. and that was an offer that someone actually
32:57
wanted. So the takeaway for you is just simple and clear. Once you're clear on
33:02
what this is, you really need to labor over figuring out the best possible
33:07
title for your free report. Like that's the thing that matters the most, right?
33:12
So you already know that like what your market wants, right? By doing the Halo
33:18
strategy. Now you must really think about how do you package that up, right?
33:24
How do you really title this thing to make it just absolutely irresistible for
33:31
your target market? Because the truth is the title of your free report is the
33:35
number one factor in the pulling power of your high-value content offer and
33:40
will largely be responsible for the amount of people that are actually going
33:43
to be entering into the top of your funnel and the amount of sales that
33:47
you're going to make. because you know you can only sell people when you've got
33:51
leads. So you really really need to do an incredible job on the lead generation
33:57
component of it. Okay. Now here's a quote from David Oglevie.
34:02
On average five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy.
34:09
When you've written your headline you've spent 80 cents out of your dollar.
34:14
That's how important this thing is. Think about how much money you are
34:18
spending or you are going to be spending on marketing.
34:21
80% of that goes straight to the headline. So, you really do need to
34:26
labor over it. You need to turn up the volume and make it something that just
34:32
drives your prospects wild, right? And you know, it really must grab attention.
34:38
Like the the whole purpose of a headline is in grabbing attention, filtering out
34:46
your target audience, generating burning intrigue, and promising benefits, right?
34:52
Use words that will shock your prospect or some kind of like thing that creates
34:58
an emotion where it's like, "What the hell?" Like that's the reaction that
35:02
you're going for in the headline that your prospect should be kind of thinking
35:06
like what what is going on here? like it just grabs them and there's so much
35:10
intrigue around it. Now, the headline's job is not to sell, right? That's not
35:17
not the game here. Like the whole goal of the headline is to get somebody to
35:24
read the next part of the copy, right? So, that's the thing that you really
35:28
need to understand. Now, when it comes to headlines, which
35:33
publication do you think has the highest paid copywriters on the planet? right?
35:38
Who who who are just like the killer copywriters? Now, you might be thinking
35:41
that it's like it's going to be some Madison Avenue huge advertising agency
35:46
or maybe it's CocaCola or Nike, right? And if you thought those things, then
35:50
you'd be wrong because the answer is gossip magazines and news publications
35:56
like Women's Weekly and AP and the National Inquir. Um, for those who are
36:01
wondering like what the National Inquirer is or what are these magazines,
36:04
it's basically one of those trashy gossip magazines in the US that you see
36:08
near the checkout in supermarkets and convenience stores. But there's a good
36:13
reason why they pay these copyrighters so much. And it's because the writers of
36:18
like the National Inquirer are among the best anywhere on earth. And I'm not
36:23
being sarcastic. They really are. If you doubt that, then you know, here's
36:27
something for you to consider. Approximately
36:31
7 million people read the National Inquirer every single week, right? Their
36:37
articles are superbly written. They are clear. They are concise. They are crisp.
36:42
And all in all, the most easily understood articles from any other
36:47
publication. And what do you think that The Inquirer writers excel the most at
36:53
above above everything else? You guessed it. Headlines. Their headlines are so
36:59
powerful and have so much grabbing power that every week people who've sworn that
37:04
they'll never ever buy such a trashy publication again are almost forced to
37:10
purchase it despite of themselves and despite of what they said to themselves.
37:14
Right? So, let's take a look at the attention grabbing and just the the raw
37:18
pulling power of these headlines. Now, Donald Trump, my first 100 days,
37:34
right? Just look at these things. Looking at just look at the wording,
37:39
right? Exposed, revealed, confession, horror, secret,
37:46
torture. These are all emotional trigger words that strike up a very visceral
37:53
action, right? And a very visceral emotions around them. It's like they
37:57
almost jolt you, right? Like Michael Douglas, gay shocker, twisted secret.
38:03
He's hiding something from Catherine. Like it's just it really grabs your
38:08
attention. And you know, if you think about like just how busy and how chaotic
38:14
it is this sea of attention, you need to use things like this that are going to
38:18
just shock people and they're going to grab them. Otherwise, you're never ever
38:21
going to have a chance of getting their attention.
38:25
Right now, let's take a moment and just look at each one of these covers and see
38:30
if you can see other like other commonalities on here other than just
38:34
like these shocking trigger words, right? I'll just bring them all up.
38:45
So, just take a moment, look through them. Can you see anything? Read them.
38:49
Read the covers. Now, there should be something that
38:55
jumps out at you. Like, other than, of course, being fixated on like better sex
39:00
and getting chiseled six-packs abs, there should be something else that just
39:04
jumps right out at you. something that adds right to the grabbing power of the
39:09
headline. Let's take a look at the first one.
39:13
Okay. Money issues. Get hired after 50. Shark Tank lessons to make you rich.

41:40
hiring a financial planner or the five things that you absolutely must know

tell you. It doesn't matter what the industry that you're in. This cut and
42:09
paste shocking report reveals the five things that you must know about X. It
42:14
just works. Like I've used it in hundreds and hundreds of industries and
42:19
it's never not worked. And remember though, right, that your prospects are
42:23
more distracted now than ever than any other time ever in history, right?
42:29
People are browsing through the web are basically like sleepwalkers and you must
42:33
jolt them and awake them like an electric shock. And because these
42:39
people, they're all just one click away from porn videos or cat videos or all
42:45
the crazy distractions. Like they got smartphones in their f like smartphones
42:50
in their pocket that they can just reach to at any time. And in the first few
42:55
seconds, you really must grab them by the throat and drag them into your copy
42:59
or into your offer, right? And the way that we do that is it brings us to rule
43:04
number three, which is making it burn with intrigue, right? It's not enough to
43:09
just get their attention and then sell them the benefits of your offer. You
43:14
also need to peique your readers interest and have them burning with
43:18
curiosity. Like, they've just got to know. They can't continue to browse
43:22
around online without knowing what those five or 10 things are. And the best way
43:27
to do that is to really dial up the intrigue in your copy and really create
43:33
like irresistible intrigue. And a great way to do that is by using words like
43:37
must, alarming, shocking, won't tell you, exposed, revealed, confession,
43:44
horror, secret, right? And you can download a full list of power words to
43:50
help you get started in the resource section of this module. I've gone and
43:54
done all the heavy lifting for you. I've got it in there. It's cut and paste. And
43:58
you really just want to focus on just dialing that thing up and have the
44:02
volume full blast on that thing. Or at least trying to add like a twist or a
44:09
qualifier to the hook of your free report like how to start and scale an
44:14
online business even if you don't know what to sell. Right? By adding that even
44:19
if you don't know what to sell, it not only qualifies people who don't know
44:23
what it is that they want to sell, but it also increases the intrigue for your
44:28
prospects to find out like how's that even possible, right? Like how am I
44:32
going to start and scale an online business if I don't know what it is that
44:35
I want to sell? And that intrigue is really what pushes people over the edge
44:41
because in the in in the words of the great late great Claude Hopkins,
44:46
curiosity is one of the strongest human incentives and it really just drives
44:52
people wild. I've split tested a whole bunch of stuff and really having, you
44:57
know, a title and a hook and a headline that has curiosity, it just pulls its
45:02
head off when it comes to getting leads. Like, it just pulls sucks in so many
45:06
leads and it's definitely a really, really dominant emotion that will move
45:11
the needle in terms of how magnetic your free report is is pulling in your dream
45:17
buyers. So, let's just look at some sidebyside examples of boring ones
45:22
versus irresistible titles. Seven things to know about a financial planner. We
45:26
obviously went over that one. An irresistible one in that market. So, you
45:30
might be urged like just saying like seven things to know about a financial
45:33
planner. And you might think, well, that is irresistible. It's not. Look at an
45:36
irresistible one. Seven alarming things that you must know before hiring a
45:40
financial planner. Number three will blow your mind. What has that done? It's
45:46
dialed up the intrigue dramatically. Why is it going to blow my mind? What is it?
45:50
I really want to know now, right? Or creating a free report that's like how
45:54
to meet men. That's not irresistible. That's boring. An irresistible one. Make
45:59
him beg to be your boyfriend in six simple steps. Notice the use of numbers.
46:04
You notice the the word beg, right? There's just things that you can tell.
46:08
Okay, this is really dialing it up for me. Five facts about web design. Would
46:12
you rather read that or would you rather 22 money murdering mistakes that no web
46:17
designer would dare tell you? Um, another one, eight things to know
46:23
about getting a divorce. Is that something that you'd be interested in?
46:25
Or would you be interested in top divorce lawyers secret checklist, the 22
46:31
tip offs your husband may be cheating on you? Again, it's just like, what are
46:35
those 22 tip offs? And it's a top divorce lawyer secret checklist. I want
46:40
to know exactly what it is and what's in that thing. Right? This brings us to
46:46
rule number four. Show them what is in it for them. Right? Your high-value
46:52
content offer should ultimately be about them and their desired outcomes. Your
46:57
prospects wants an immediate benefit. They have questions that they want
47:01
answered. And the key is to write about them and not you. Everybody wants the
47:07
silver bullet. the silver like the simple system, the cut and paste
47:11
template, the cheat sheet or secret solution, right? So, sell them what they
47:16
want and then give them what it is that they need, right? Show them how they'll
47:23
learn simple tips that will help them solve their problem or help them answer
47:27
that question. And then show them what their desired outcome looks like and
47:31
then educate them on how to actually get there. And that's the payoff for the
47:35
reader, right? That's the payoff that they get in exchange for giving you
47:39
their name and their email address. So you must add as many specific and vi
47:46
vivid details as possible. Now at this stage you might be wondering like well
47:51
what do I actually put inside my free report? And the answer is that it
47:57
doesn't need to be your life's work. It's not like some huge scripture this
48:02
magnum opus that your grandchildren are going to look at. It's it's just like,
48:06
you know, you want to get started with just a basic five-page report and you
48:11
can repurpose a blog post if you want to. You can take your FAQs and make them
48:16
into something. But whatever it is, it can't just be like some promotional
48:21
piece of crap that's just talking about your company. It needs to talk about
48:25
them. It needs to have value. Because really the way that I look at it is when
48:30
somebody gives you their name and email address, that is the very first
48:36
transaction that takes place with your business. Whether or not they've used
48:40
real money in a currency, their name and an email address is that currency. And
48:44
you really want to overd deliver on your promises that you made. And that doesn't
48:49
mean that it needs to be a 100 pages. That means that it just needs to be of
48:52
genuine value and genuinely help your prospect where they are. It can't just
48:58
be like, "Hey, I tricked you. I got you. I got your name and email address.
49:02
Here's our catalog of our services or of our products." That's not how it works.
49:06
Now, the four rules for creating a highvalue content offer like with a
49:12
headline that really just pulls in is this headline formula. It must be an
49:18
urgent problem. It must be unique and it must be useful and it also must be ultra
49:24
specific, right? So, you just got to have all four of those present in your
49:30
headline in order to get it to work, right? So, you you really do want to
49:35
look at having all four. But look, if if you have two missing, like the
49:39
headline's just not going to hold attention. It's just not going to grab
49:43
your prospect as much. So, make sure that you have all four of those
49:47
elements. And let me break those down for you. So first up is urgent. This is
49:52
easy. Simply just convey that there is a limited time to get your high-value
49:56
content offer. Like download your free report before this page comes down or
50:01
before we start charging money for it. Unique.
50:05
This, in my opinion, is the most important element because it must be
50:11
burning with intrigue by being something that is strange and something that is
50:17
unique that they have never ever seen or heard of before, right? Cuz that's how
50:21
you're going to stand out and get cut through. Useful. There has to be some
50:25
implied benefit for the reader to continue reading. It can't just be like
50:29
blind curiosity where you're not promising any benefit or any end result.
50:34
And then it must be ultra specific. So it's important that it plants depth into
50:39
the claim. It increases your believability and at least enough that
50:43
the reader may investigate further by giving you their name and email address.
50:48
Right? So go as specific as legally possible, but don't lie, right? How to
50:54
get seven clients in the next seven days. How to lose 9 kilos in the next 6
51:00
weeks or whatever it might be. like it needs to it can't just be like how to
51:05
get in better shape. It needs to be specific because it's really that ultra
51:10
specificity that really does like add some depth to the claims that you're
51:15
making. Now, let's just think about like you
51:20
might still be thinking like Sabri, I just can't get my head around like you
51:24
wanting me to title this thing that is going to be competing with gossip
51:28
magazines or clickbait online or all these banner ads.
51:32
This is the battlefield of attention, right? This is what the average person's
51:37
browser looks like, right? It's just downright insane. Like 47% of people
51:46
have between six and 25 tabs open at a time and the other 50% of people have
51:54
one to five. Like that just straight out the gate, like look at that chaos. that
51:59
is what you're competing with. And a lot of those things are going to be more
52:04
entertaining than what it is that you're promising. So if you don't have
52:08
something that is really compelling from the get- go, it's you're just dead on
52:13
arrival. So like you need to get over this, right? You need to be open to the
52:18
fact that like you are in a war for attention and you need to make sure that
52:22
you win that war. This is just somebody's like browser tab, right? Then
52:27
you've got like their computer and all of the different widgets that are open
52:31
in their dock. Then you've got their smartphone, right? Which also got these
52:37
little red notification hell that is also vying for their attention. So if
52:42
you combined all three of those, like there is no overplaying that it is a
52:48
blizzard of chaos, absolute chaos that you're competing with. It's like having
52:53
your prospect blindfolded in the back of a car full of people that are all having
52:59
conversations and the music is turned up full blast and your prospect is
53:04
blindfolded. That is what you are competing with. That is what this is.
53:08
That is this battlefield for attention. So, you really need to believe what I'm
53:13
telling you and work on that title of your highv value content offer. It's
53:18
even more important than the content that you put into that. But don't worry,
53:22
I'm not leaving you high and dry and just saying like go and figure that out
53:26
yourself. No, no, no. I'm here to rescue once again. So, the way that you're
53:31
going to do that is you're going to be by combining your Halo strategy
53:35

53:39

56:54
play and deploy that right in your business. Now, why is this so effective?
57:00
So, like everything, I write I really like to break things down and look at
57:05
the constituent parts. You know, when I find something that works, I don't just
57:10
run with it. I like to know why. And I like to know the building blocks that
57:14
make it up. So then I can go and I can deploy this in other areas using other
57:19
things and get compounding results, right? And that's really how you grow
57:25
exponentially and you experience quantum growth, right? So let's have a look at

brings us to this behavioral model. Okay, which is behavior equals

57:49
behavior and this is really the motivation. So we want to look at okay
57:52
well what is it that affects that? Like what is it that's going to affect
57:56
somebody being motivated to download our free report? And the first one is
58:01
burning intrigue. And then the the second one is the big promise. And then
58:06
the third one is the specificity of it. Right? And they're the three things that
58:13
is going to basically motivate somebody to want to give you their name and email
58:18
address in exchange for your highv value content offer. And then the the second
58:23
part of the model in terms of why it is so brutally effective is just the time
58:28
commitment component of it. Like it's a free report, right? there is very
58:32
limited time commitment that is required for that end user in order to get it
58:37
what it is that they want. The second thing is money. It's free, right? There
58:41
is no risk for them to get this. The skepticism can be lowered. And then the
58:48
the third one is thought. Like there's just not a lot of thought that has to go
58:52
into it's like do I want it or do I not want it? It looks irresistible. It's
58:55
highly motivating. Let me go out and get this thing. Right? That brings us to the
59:00
third point which is trigger. And it's because it really floods the brain with
59:07
a release of dopamine where they get that instant gratification and the ease
59:13
of use of it. And it's just it just hits on all of these three different
59:19
behavioral triggers that really just the way that people are wired, right? And
59:25
that's the reason why it works so brutally effective. And that's the
59:30
reason that I believe that, you know, when you get started, free reports are
59:33
just the easiest, most effective way to do it because it delivers on all of
59:37
these things in the behavioral model. And that's the reason why it just
59:41
creates a surge of activity and activity in terms of leads and then, you know,
59:47
phone calls and sales. So that's the really like breaking it down into this
59:51
model so you can understand, you know, how this thing works, right? So that's
59:57
exactly how to create a lethally potent high-v value content offer and why why
1:00:02
really they're so important and really the profound effect that they can have
1:00:07
on your business. And what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going
1:00:13
over later in this program of exactly where this actual part fits into your
1:00:20
salesunnel. Like how do you use it? How do you get somebody that's taken this
1:00:24
free report? And then how do you actually convert them and enroll them
1:00:28
into a highpaying client? And how do you do that every single week and every
1:00:33
single day and get those people, those prospects, you know, to pay top dollar
1:00:39
and really look to you as the number one authority that's going to help them
1:00:43
solve that problem. We'll get into exactly how we do that later on in this
1:00:48
program in terms of how it fits into the funnel, but for now really what you want
1:00:52
to do is look at the resources down download them and your action items for
1:00:57
this module is to study the Halo strategy worksheet. You see that thing
1:01:01
just keeps on coming up over and over and over again. And that's why I
1:01:05
obsessed on you spending a huge amount of time on getting those things right
1:01:10
because once you get that right, all of this stuff almost writes itself. Okay?
1:01:16
Then you really want to identify by looking at that worksheet of what is
1:01:20
that number one most burning problem that your market is experiencing. And
1:01:25
then you want to write 10 eyeball grabbing highv value content offer
1:01:29
titles for your free report. Right? Not just one or two. Write 10. and then
1:01:34
eliminate the best three and then ask, you know, some friends and some
1:01:39
co-workers about which ones are the most irresistible and then juice them up even
1:01:43
more. Then you pick the winner and then you produce your high value content
1:01:49
offer, right? And then you've got this, you've got this asset in your business
1:01:54
that we're going to fit into the rest of our funnel that's going to go out there,
1:01:58
grab eyeballs, suck in leads, and really create all these opportunities for your
1:02:03
business. So, go ahead, get to work, get busy on that stuff, and I will see you
1:02:07
in the next video.

Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to today's module of quantum growth
0:07
called assessing the terrain. And this module is really about just that,
0:13
assessing the battlefield in that we operate in or that our offers are going
0:17
to be out there competing for attention and that we're trying to going to be
0:21
convincing prospects to part with their hard-earned money over the competition
0:26
and come to us as a client. And this is an absolutely
0:31
critical critical step in making sure that you're setting up an offer that's
0:36
going to go out there and just crush the competition. And this is a step that I
0:40
see far too many established businesses ever go through this exercise like going
0:46
through and finding out not just like you know seeing a few of their websites
0:51
and that's about it or seeing what they're doing on the surface level and
0:54
on the front end. I'm talking about understanding fully their business and
0:58
their backend and how many salespeople that they have and everything, right? We
1:02
want to really assess what's going on. So, before we dive into exactly how to
1:07
do that, let's just have a look at what we'll be covering in today's training.
1:11
So, we'll be starting off with 4D funnel hacking, then competitor offer mapping,
1:16
X-ray competitive intelligence, buying the golden feeasant, exposing the
1:21
enemy's foundation, and striking like lightning. All right, so let's dig in.
1:27
So, let's start with this quote by Sunzu from his book, The Art of War. If you
1:33
know the enemy and you know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
1:37
hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory
1:42
gained, you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
1:47
yourself, you will succumb in every battle. So, I don't care how good you
1:53
think you are, how good you think your offer is, or you think that you're just
1:57
the best person out in the marketplace. We are going to find out because we are
2:02
going to take a fullon four-dimensional scan of your marketplace and uncover
2:08
just some gems of wisdom so we can really pump your offer up on steroids so
2:14
nobody has a chance against you. And from the very getgo, from the offer
2:18
creation just before we even get in to the actual business and all of that
2:23
stuff, we're already winning from the outset. And it's because we understand
2:27
not only our prospect better than anybody else, we also understand the
2:32
competitive battlefield and the landscape as well better than any of the
2:36
players on the field. So 4D funnel hacking. So 4D funnel
2:43
hacking is really having a look and seeing exactly what your competitors are
2:48
doing, where they're getting their traffic from, and what pages that
2:52
they're sending them to, and how much money are they, you know, potentially
2:56
spending on that traffic generation, and which are the traffic channels that are
3:00
making up the largest amount of their customer base and their traffic flow and
3:04
their leads and all of the subsequent things that spill off those things. and
3:10
really getting just that x-ray vision of what's going on in their business and
3:14
how are they actually going out and getting customers. And you might be
3:18
thinking like on God's green earth, how do you do that, Sabri? I really want to
3:22
know how to do that. Well, I'm going to show you right now exactly how to do
3:26
that. So, basically, let's dive in. So, first of all, let's go over to Google.
3:31
And basically, what we'll do is this is where we're going to be putting all the
3:35
information that we're gathering today, right? So, this right here is the
3:41
competitor offer mapping spreadsheet. And this essentially is, you can see on
3:46
here, this is the stuff that we're going to be covering. We're going to be
3:49
having, you know, three main competitors that we're going to be shopping. And
3:52
we're going to be looking at obviously their business name and what are they
3:56
using as their highv value content offer. You know, what is their primary
4:00
call to action on their landing pages and on their website? What traffic
4:04
channels are they running? We're going to be collecting the different URLs for
4:08
all the landing pages that they've got. We're going to be looking at did they
4:11
have a guarantee? How do they add scarcity to their offer? What do they
4:16
say their offer is worth? So, what's their value positioning out there? Their
4:20
bonuses, do they include any other freebies or bonuses along with their
4:24
core offer? Um, what do you get for their service that they provide? Like,
4:28
what is it that you actually get? Um, what is the price that their that their
4:33
offer is situated at? um what is their payment plan if they have any? Do they
4:37
split it up? Is it monthly? Is it all lump sum? Do they take a deposit? How
4:41
does it work? We want to know all of these things. And you're going to
4:44
understand exactly why in a moment. Um and then what is their position out
4:47
there in the marketplace, right? Are they expensive? Are they volume? Are
4:52
they going for high tier, you know, niche services? We're going to find out
4:56
all of this stuff, right? So, the place that we're going to start with though is
5:01
Google. And I always like to kind of switch it up and give a little bit of
5:04
variety when I do these examples. So everyone from all different kinds of
5:09
service-based businesses can see applications. So let's take a look and
5:13
we'll say that today that we're going to really be assessing the terrain in the
5:17
financial planning space. Right? So we'll type in financial planner
5:23
and let's just have a look at what we've got here. So the first listing what
5:27
we're going to do is unfortunately we are going to cost all these people some
5:30
money. This is just a part of the game and we're going to start looking. So
5:36
first of all I'm always, you know, you're always going to want to look at,
5:40
you know, what is the person that's bidding the most aggressively um on paid
5:43
search doing? What what is it? Because they're obviously spending a lot of
5:47
dough. Um and we want to click in and and really dive into these guys first.
5:51
Okay, so this is the landing page that they're arriving you on. Um,
5:58
which could just be their homepage of their website. U, we will find out in a
6:02
moment. All right, so let's see what we're really looking at here. Let's look
6:05
at their headline. Manage your wealth. Okay, so these people obviously don't
6:09
know anything about writing sales copy, which is good news for us. Um, and then
6:14
their sub headline is financial advice that endures.
6:18
This is their thing. All right. First resemblance of an offer here, request a
6:23
chat. Okay. Our approach to financial advice follows a proven methodology. We
6:30
invest time to understand your unique needs, present a plan with a transparent
6:34
fee structure, and continue to review its relevance over the long term. That's
6:38
our commitment to you. Whether you're an individual, a business owner, not for-p
6:43
profofit, or an indigenous community, talk to us. Please fill in the form
6:48
below or contact us on this phone number. Right? This is just absolutely
6:54
what everybody does and it just they're trying to cater to everybody. Look at
6:59
this thing. Right? Individuals, business owners, nonfor-profit and indigenous
7:04
community members. Like they're they're really really casting that net as far as
7:09
they possibly can. And the reason for that is everybody always wants to appeal
7:14
to everyone. And when you do that, you appeal to no one. But that's a that's a
7:19
lesson for for a later training. Um, requested chat. So that's that's their
7:23
offer. Got some video testimonials, which is
7:27
good. And then our five steps to superior advice.
7:34
All right. This is what they do. This is their process. This is okay. It's at
7:37
least telling us kind of what's involved. And then a form and get in
7:42
touch. Okay. So what am I getting in touch for? So I am getting in touch to
7:47
take the first step. Please submit the form and a specialist
7:50
adviser will contact you. 97% of perpetual private clients are happy with
7:56
the quality of their financial advice. Perpetual net promoter score survey
8:00
research are conducted by Walcott Research. Okay.
8:04
So this is what they're doing. Now, the very first thing that we want to do when
8:09
we're diving into exactly what's going So, this is a very surface level stuff,
8:13
right? You want to click on this link. All right. So, this is just anchored to
8:17
the bottom of the page. Nothing magical here.
8:21
I'll close these other competitors for now and we'll come back to them in a
8:24
moment. Right. So, let's take this person. So now what we want to do is we
8:28
want to take their their URL up here and we want to go to a website called
8:33
semrush.com. Now there is you know free services and
8:38
there's paid services. Um of course for myself I have the paid services and I
8:43
suggest that you do the same as well. It it's absolute peanuts. You know I think
8:48
you can get a plan for $30 or $40 a month or something like that. And then
8:51
basically what it does is you're allow you basically plug in your competitor's
8:56
URL and then what it does is it brings up all the okay so this has got on
9:03
United States let's make it to Australia and it brings up all the data on this
9:07
competitor like it shows us okay this client um ranks or this person ranks for
9:12
25,000 keywords organically and they're bidding on 1.5,000 keywords on Google
9:19
ads which is what we saw here. They're their position one up here. Um, so
9:23
they've got 1,500 keywords. And then what we can do is so first of
9:29
all, we'll we'll have a look at the paid search of things. So if you click on
9:33
advertising research here on the left hand side, now it's going to bring up
9:38
their Google ads. Okay? And it's going to show us here we've got the timeline
9:42
and we can see, okay, well they have been running ads in some way, shape, or
9:46
form since 2012. Right? So, there's a lot of data in here and then they ran it
9:51
for a while and then they stopped for a while and then they've been running it
9:55
consistently since 2015. Um, so yeah, this is you got five years of solid data
10:02
to to really dig into. And then what it's showing us is
10:07
these are all the keywords that they're bidding on. So, perpetual being their
10:11
brand name, um, but also a lot of other things as well. Um, super contribution,
10:16
2,900 searches. And then so this is showing us the keyword. Then this shows
10:20
us the volume. And then this shows us what the average cost per click is in in
10:26
USD. So we obviously can convert that to AUD for instance for this one. And we go
10:33
this USD to AUD and we'll see. Okay. So it's 10 bucks and 44 cents a click.
10:39
Okay, cool. Um not not cheap given the volume. And then also what it does is it
10:46
allows us to see the historic position. And we can see that historically they've
10:50
been position two. They've been bidding position two. Um but since December
10:54
they've gone up to position one and they're aggressively bidding for that
10:56
keyword. So it's probably working right if that's the case.
11:01
And then not only that, but then it also estimates how much traffic that they are
11:07
getting based on the average click-through rate of an ad and and how
11:12
much search volume that they are. So you could just and look not all of these
11:16
numbers are complete gospel, right? It's like anything everything's based off
11:20
like they've got their own system and their own algorithm where we're going to
11:23
be cross referencing this data, right? So say for instance this one 136 clicks.
11:28
You could just literally just go cool they got 136
11:33
times the $1044 per click. So they're spending $1,500 alone just on that one
11:39
keyword, right? So, that's a lot of dough um just for one keyword alone. But
11:44
then what we can do is we can click here and we can go look at the landing page.
11:48
Uh-oh. This is where they're sending their traffic. So the there happens to
11:53
be for that ad, it's going to just a page not found for error that is costing
11:58
them a lot of money, right? And unfortunately like all of these keywords
12:02
here, same URL, all going to a not found page. So that's
12:08
a lot of dough. If we click on this page,
12:11
also not found. Okay, this one's working. This is
12:18
they're sending this traffic to their homepage. Um, then we've got this and
12:23
we've got that's the same one. Let's have a look at these.
12:29
So, they're running a lot of traffic to pages that don't even exist right now.
12:35
Um, which is just crazy. So, they may have just updated their website and all
12:41
the URL slugs have changed and that's the reason why there's no there's no
12:45
pause. But what we do know is that there are currently pages there's currently
12:50
traffic going to these pages. Um, and they're not they're not showing
12:55
anything. And unfortunately, this is something that you do see all the time,
12:59
right? But you can see from here that they have these different pages set up
13:03
that they're running traffic to. Um, and what you can do is typically when this
13:09
does work and they're not sending them to a dud page, you can actually find out
13:13
where that traffic's going. Or alternatively, maybe they've recently
13:17
literally just changed their website now. So, what you can do is click on
13:20
this, do a do a Google search for that keyword,
13:26
and then see if their ad if you can find their ad.
13:35
No, can't find it right now. Probably because we've been cookied and we've
13:37
already checked their domain name. Anyhow, I digress. You can see all the
13:41
keywords that they're bidding on, right? And you can get an estimation here. You
13:45
can even have a look at the last year. You can see, okay, look, it looks like
13:47
in August their their traffic spikes. They spend a bit more money. There's
13:51
obviously something happening in August. It might be the just after the end of
13:55
the financial year that people are looking for a financial planner there.
13:59
So, there's obviously some seasonality in here.
14:02
Then we can see that this is estimating that on average that they're spending
14:07
$16,000 a month on Google ads. Right now, this number in my opinion is not
14:13
accurate. Um, but it's still a good benchmark and gives you some clear like
14:19
some idea basically of what's going on. But if you really want to get a real
14:24
detailed understanding, you can export all of these keywords. So you can just
14:28
select them all, export them, and then just basically go work out and sum up
14:35
all of the value of all these keywords that they're bidding on, and then just
14:39
say on average that they get 2% of that traffic. You know, on average, average
14:43
click-through rate, you know, is anywhere between 2 to 4% on an ad. Um,
14:48
so that will give you an idea and then you can do find out the average cost per
14:51
click if you really want to find out. But for now, what we're doing is we're
14:54
just trying to find out what are the keywords that that they're bidding on.
14:59
Where are they getting traffic from? Where are they sending that traffic to?
15:04
Um, and finding out what their offers look like, right? So, this is the page
15:10
that we that we arrived on before. So, their primary call to action on this one
15:16
is request to chat. So, what we want to do is we want to get their name. I'm
15:22
just going to copy it because I don't want to rewrite it out. Um, and we want
15:27
to put it in here. And I'll just put it in here for
15:31
competitor one, just so you've got it right. Um,
15:35
so perpetual is the name of this person. And this is basically what we're going
15:42
to start doing now is we are going to work our way down the sheet and get an
15:47
understanding of what's going on. So, we know that their primary call to action
15:51
is request a chat. So, we're going to put that in there. Um, what are they
15:57
using as a highv value content author? Nothing. They don't have any
16:04
download or you can get off them without having to speak to somebody,
16:10
right? It's straight speak to a salesperson immediately and buy some
16:13
[ __ ] So then what we want to look at is next up,
16:19
where are they getting traffic from? Okay, so we know that they're running
16:23
Google ads because we've seen that and we've seen all these keywords and we can
16:26
just literally the the incredible thing about SEM Rush is that you can just go
16:31
bang export and just download all of these keywords, right? So they're
16:36
bidding on um you know 31 keywords. the traffic that they're saying that they're
16:40
getting is 1.5,000 visits per month from that. Um, and you can just download that
16:45
and away you go, right? And then in in addition to that, what you can also do
16:50
is you can have a look at some of their other competitors and this will give you
16:54
ideas as well um of other people and what they're spending. And it also shows
16:59
you where they are mapped in the marketplace like based on how much
17:04
traffic that they're getting and how much keywords. And then these other PL
17:07
people are going to be good people to have a look at as well and see well what
17:12
are they doing and what are they spending and what's going on. And then
17:14
again you can get the full list here. Then what we can do as well is we can
17:21
download every single ad that they're running, right? We can just come in here
17:25
and go cool. Yep. Give us these ads. And then away we go. We get all their ads.
17:30
And they got 31 different ads in here. and their like their ads are are very
17:36
dry and and very boring, but we won't get into that right now. Right now, all
17:40
we're doing is just trying to get a read and just trying to assess what's going
17:44
on. Right. So, we get all this. We can download all their ads. Now, we've got
17:47
all their keywords and we've got all their ads
17:54
and then we can have a look at this and we can have a look at how they've
17:57
changed their ads over time and there's any common patterns or anything.
18:01
Typically, you're not going to be looking at a whole lot of these to be
18:04
honest. Um, and you can look at their pages and any subdomains that they've
18:09
got set up. As I said, these are all like the landing pages that they're
18:12
running. You can export all of their landing pages and then you've got all
18:15
their landing pages. And you typically want to just keep this on a folder in
18:19
your computer under competitive research. And you want to be doing this
18:23
like every quarter and finding out what the competitors are doing and seeing if
18:26
anything changes in your market, right? um you can check if they've got any
18:30
other subdomains that they're running traffic to or anything like that. So
18:34
then what we can also do is once we go back to the domain overview, we can have
18:39
a look at like how how well are they going organically as well. How are they
18:43
ranking, you know, in the free listings? What keywords are they going for? All of
18:47
that kind of stuff. So we can see that they got they rank for 6,600 different
18:52
keywords. and the traffic that they generate from their organic traffic
18:56
estimates that it would cost them 245k per year. Again, this number is not
19:02
correct. It's obviously a lot larger. Um, it's it will be a lot less than
19:06
this, I should say. Um, but again, it's good to go down here, have a look at
19:10
those keywords, have a look at what's going on. You can say, well, what are
19:13
the keywords that are driving most of the volume in this in this space? Um,
19:18
and they've got commercial real estate, they've got perpetual, got investing,
19:22
Australian super, a whole bunch of stuff going on here. Financial, end of
19:25
financial year. Um, so these are a whole bunch of different keywords and you want
19:31
to have a look through both of them just to get an understanding. I do like
19:34
looking at the paid stuff more because you know that that specifically these
19:38
are the keywords that they're willing to pay for. Then after we've done that,
19:43
what we want to do is we want to go to another website
19:46
called similar web. Now this website is free.
19:53
Again, there is a paid option um but you can get what you need more or less out
19:59
of the free option. And and basically the only difference with SEM Rush with a
20:03
paid account and non-paid account is it's not going to give you every single
20:06
keyword. They'll give you 10 or 15 keywords that they're bidding on. and
20:09
either you want to get the full list um then then you have to pay or they'll
20:14
give you limited amount of searches. So a limited amount of competitors like
20:18
you're not allowed to do more than five searches per day under the free account.
20:21
So look I suggest definitely getting the paid um and at least doing a really deep
20:26
dive across the board um or you are really tight on money you can get away
20:31
on on on the free version as well. You will be able to get you know a lot of
20:34
useful stuff. So similar web basically you come across to simil similar web
20:38
which is just another website where again we're going to put in their
20:41
website and click on it. Now what this does is it shows us a
20:48
little bit of seasonality in terms of roughly what's going on. Um it also
20:54
tells us and pulls data based on like how many employees that they have and
20:58
they you know pull this data from a combination of LinkedIn and other
21:01
different sites to get that. Um, but this is estimating that these guys are
21:05
getting 53,000 visits per month. So, if we have a look back at what Semrush said
21:12
on the domain overview in terms of the the amount of traffic that they get per
21:17
month, you can see that it is going to be quite different in terms of the the
21:23
overall amount of traffic that they're getting. So, this is saying that they
21:26
get 1.5,000 visitors and then organic that they get 25,000 visitors from that.
21:32
Um, so you know, if you're looking at those, we're still under 30K where this
21:36
says 53K. Again, there's none of these sites are absolutely perfect. They don't
21:40
have direct access to your Google Analytics, so they can't tell you
21:43
definitively. They use a combination of like, you know, server loads and a whole
21:48
bunch of different, you know, multiple different data points to kind of
21:52
ascertain that, but you can start to map out and get an understanding.
21:57
Now what you can see here is the average duration on their website is 2 minutes
22:01
and 47 seconds. Pages per visit is four. They have a 38% bounce rate. Now 95% of
22:08
their traffic comes from Australia, which is exactly what you would expect
22:11
to see from a financial planning service that is operating in a geography. Right?
22:16
Then you can get the full list of countries if you want. That's not really
22:19
super important. This is what's really interesting.
22:23
Traffic sources. So what you can see here is that the majority of their
22:29
traffic is coming from Facebook uh sorry is coming from Google right is coming
22:34
from search and you know we saw the amount of traffic that they were getting
22:38
from their paid ads and also from their free ads and it's just interesting to
22:43
see and then you can see direct they get a lot of search traffic direct to their
22:46
brand name um or people coming through to their website that have bookmarked it
22:50
that might be from a percentage of clients or whatnot. um doesn't look like
22:54
they do a whole lot of email marketing or Facebook marketing because only 1% of
22:59
the traffic is coming from social um you know.13%
23:03
is coming from email um some basic retargeting 045%
23:10
but this is really the lion share right they've obviously got a big healthy
23:13
brand because there's lots of people searching for it and they get a lot of
23:15
direct traffic and also you know the direct traffic can come through as a
23:21
result of email if they don't have like URL parameters properly set up, but we
23:27
won't get into that just for now. So, we can see and we can confidently say that
23:31
look, the most amount of the their customers right now is coming from
23:35
search because this is what's making up 31% of their traffic. Um, and that could
23:38
be driving a lot of their direct traffic as well. Then we can see what websites
23:44
that they're getting the highest amount of searches from. So, you can go to you
23:49
can see that they're getting a lot of traffic from Whirlpool.
23:52
um and there's people coming through from this and then you could go to here
23:57
and you could search for their brand and you'd be able to find, you know,
24:02
articles on that if you wanted to and just see there's any insights for you to
24:06
go and have a look. Um but for now, we're not going to dive into that. So
24:12
then you can have a look at like these are the keywords that are driving most
24:16
of this is like the breakdown of their of their traffic, right? So the top five
24:20
organic keywords are pretty much all brand. Well, they are all brand. And
24:25
then the top paid ones are their brand and then financial advisor and financial
24:30
planner. And then we can see social, you know,
24:34
it's all coming from Twitter and Reddit, so they're definitely not running any
24:38
Facebook ads. There's no need to go and look at that for now. Um, and then also
24:43
it will give you some other of their competitors. Another great thing to kind
24:47
of cross reference with. um and having a look. Okay, okay, cool.
24:51
These are the other competitors and then you can start this whole process for
24:55
them. So, we know that if we come to our offer mapping
25:01
that they're doing Google
25:05
and that's really about it. They they've got obviously direct traffic which
25:10
everyone will have. Um and they don't even have really anything on the email
25:15
side of thing that's worth talking about. their URLs. You can list um their
25:20
just their main website here because we are going to be we've already downloaded
25:26
or you should have already downloaded their their URLs and saved them to your
25:31
computer to put in there. Um so you've got a like you know exactly what's going
25:35
on at this stage. Let's go have a look and see if there is any guarantees. And
25:40
a way to do this is you can just get their URL and then
25:46
you can just put guarantee at the end of it.
25:52
Capital guarantee option. Let's see. Nothing on that.
26:12
And it doesn't appear that they have a guarantee. Typically, they do. They're
26:16
going to be using it front and center. Um, and even if we search for Google or
26:20
their website, we can't find anything. Right. So, here
26:25
we're going to write none. There wasn't any scarcity around their
26:29
phone call. Um, what do they say their offer is worth?
26:34
They don't. What are their bonuses? Nothing of that. What do you get? offer
26:37
price is this payment plan? No, no, no. So, at this stage, this is the data that
26:42
we've got on this competitor, right? And we're going to be answering this this
26:48
stuff in the next step. So, then what we do is we go back to Google and we can
26:55
just close these guys for now. And what we will do is we'll have a look
27:00
at the next one on the chopping and block.
27:04
Okay. So this is their their website. Awardwinning wealth experts. Chat with a
27:10
wealth expert today. So this is their offer and it seems like
27:19
everyone's kind of going down this road of of wanting to chat with you. Um and
27:25
that's just like that's just the language that it seems the last two
27:28
people that we've looked at really in terms of what they're they're pushing.
27:33
So this company's name was Future Assist, right? So put these guys
27:41
down as our second competitor. And whether or not you feel like these
27:50
people are your competitor or not, like they are because they are coming up for
27:54
the keywords that people will use in order to find you with your financial
27:58
planner. Okay, so this is their offer and then they've got Okay, so the winner
28:04
name, email, and post code, no comments or anything. Property
28:09
investing, tax minimization, da da da, grow your wealth without altering your
28:13
lifestyle. So these guys are at least speaking a little bit more in the
28:18
language that we would want to see. 500 plus five-star Google reviews. Yep,
28:22
that's definitely impressive. Yeah,
28:28
team of experts. What do we have here? Oh, no. Affordable advice, research
28:33
driven. I thought this was going to be a highv value content offer, but it is
28:36
not. Um, tools to tools to keep you on track. They've got a bunch of these
28:40
guys, these wealth strategists and whatnot here. Frequently asked questions
28:48
and that's it. So, their their thing is they've got a few mix messages. So,
28:54
we've got get started today and that's h have a chat with them. Um, and having a
28:59
chat, get started with the right person on your side. You can achieve your
29:03
financial freedom. Take the first step today. And what else do we have?
29:08
So, their offer is really just get started today. Have a free chat. Request
29:12
a free chat. Right. So, there we go. That's their offer. Let's stick it in
29:17
here. Request a free chat. This is request a
29:22
chat. This is request a free chat. So definitely request a free chat is
29:26
better. They did not have a highv value content offer.
29:32
Now let's go ahead and have a look at their traffic.
29:45
So again we plug this into SCM Rush and let's see what we can find. Now, just
29:51
know that like with SEM Rush, it doesn't always have the data. More often than
29:55
not, it does, but sometimes you can see competitors that are running ads, but
29:59
then when you plug them into SEM Rush, there isn't anything. But we're lucky
30:03
and we've got it here. So, let's first of all, what we can see here is that
30:07
there's definitely activity. There's both, you know, organic SEO activity
30:11
happening and then they've been really ramping up their paid search side of
30:14
things and their paid traffic on Google Ads. So the first place that we want to
30:18
go is the advertising research.
30:26
Now the last person we looked at had 31 odd
30:31
keywords that they were that they were bidding on. This person has 49. Um and
30:36
the traffic is saying 535. Traffic cost is $2,000. Um, and you can see that it
30:43
looks like that they've only really started to kind of ramp things up now.
30:46
Um, so again, these are all their keywords. You bang, let's download these
30:50
puppies. Boom. Get them, download them, put them in a folder, type on that that
30:55
the competitor's name in there, and then away you go. Right now, Property
30:59
Investment Australia, Financial Advisor, Melbourne. Let's have a look
31:05
and see what we've got here. Let's hope that is not the page that
31:10
they are sending them to. What I'm going to do is just copy this
31:17
URL. I think that little button's having a freak out.
31:23
Uhoh. It does actually look like they Oh no. Um,
31:34
so they may have updated it. This is the keyword that it's going to um it
31:38
appears. Let's have a look at this
31:45
wealth experts. And then if we have a look at this one, um it looks like they
31:50
used to have a page that was financial advice Melbourne. Um, and if we go to
31:56
their work website here, wealth strategy.
32:07
Hang on. We've got a free resources section here. Let's see. They've got
32:10
something. Oh, they do. We've got a highv value
32:15
content offer. Somebody call the police. All right, we
32:20
found one. Okay, so this person has got get your report. Find the emerging
32:24
hotspots. All right. So, this is only for property
32:28
investors. It's not for financial planners. So, we we can't really grade
32:33
them it, right? We can't really include it on there because we're we're
32:36
specifically talking about the financial planning side of things. Um, and that
32:41
would be that side of things. So, it doesn't really give us what I what we
32:44
need. Um, it definitely appears that they've changed their URLs, but we
32:47
already have it from clicking on one of their ads.
32:50
So we can download their full list of keywords and we can see all the landing
32:53
pages that we've run. We know that they've got property offers as well. So
32:56
they're doing the property investments. You only want to really be looking at
32:59
the things that are going to really really appeal to you. Again, you want to
33:02
download their landing pages and check out what's going on. Then we can like
33:07
we've got their keywords. This is their keyword growth over time. So they've
33:11
been increasing the amount of keywords. This is their traffic cost. That's also
33:14
been going up over time. And you can look at it like last 6 months. You can
33:18
look at it the last two years. or you can look at it all time, however you
33:22
choose. I typically like looking at over the last year. Then again, ad copy.
33:29
Boom. We got all their ads. Let's download those. And then away we go. Um
33:34
ad history. You can see anything on this. Um we can see that this kind of
33:39
correlates with the other stuff that we were looking at before. Like they're
33:42
they're ramping things up now. Pages. We can get all their pages again and see.
33:47
Okay, cool. These are the ones that they're running. This is what's going
33:50
on. This is what's happening. Didn't mean to do that. Um, but yeah,
33:55
you can get an idea of what's going on. Downloading those keywords and finding
33:59
what's what. Subdomains. They got any subdomains. No, they don't. Um, let's
34:04
have a look at their organic as well and see what's going on organically.
34:13
So only 685 keywords as opposed to the the first company that had like 20,000
34:19
plus investment loans rate financial advisor
34:27
Sydney. Again you can just download all these and you can review it and see if
34:31
there's anything that you're going to be able to gain from it. Um so there we are
34:35
here. Again, we know that. Let's actually go over. We've got one
34:40
more thing to do, and that is to look at Similar Web. Let's plug them into
34:46
Similar Web and have a look and see what's going on. Now, Similar Web
34:50
typically needs a lot more data in order to find it. So, I find that like, yeah,
34:55
a lot of the time you do get this where they can't give you the traffic overview
35:00
if the the website's not getting enough traffic, but it still gives you a mobile
35:03
view, desktop view, and we can start to see here. So, this is different. So,
35:09
504% of all their traffic comes from search. Um, so that's where 54% of their
35:15
customers will be coming from. However, that they've definitely got more display
35:18
on there. So, we'll see if we can find anything from that in a moment. Um,
35:23
again, no referrals or any of these kind of things cuz it's just not enough. Um,
35:27
it looks like for their paid search that they're more aggressively going for the
35:32
property investment, investment property side of things. And then from their
35:36
organic, you got like certified financial planners and whatnot. It's
35:39
just an interesting point to make. Here's here's something interesting. So,
35:42
Facebook. So, it's saying here that they get 1% of
35:47
their traffic from social. um we will have a look and see if they're running
35:52
anything on Facebook. And the way that we do that is we bring up a Google
35:55
search and we simply type in Facebook ad library.
36:05
Okay. Now when you click on this you want to be logged in and it will
36:10
basically bring up the library. And what we can do here is we can just get the
36:15
the person's name, which is future assist. And if you're lucky, sometimes
36:22
you can just pop it in here and you'll get what you need. Here we go.
36:26
Beautiful. We got what we need. It doesn't appear that they're running
36:30
any ads. And you do want to refresh this page, you know, two or three times
36:34
because you'll find sometimes that there are ads running and they do pop up when
36:38
you click that. But it doesn't look like these guys are are running any Facebook
36:41
ads. So again, come over here.
36:47
Google, we know that they're doing display. They're doing.
36:52
And what else did we have here? And direct. Um, we can't get any
37:03
referral sites off here. But yeah, so we'll come back to our
37:08
sheet. We've got direct here. We know the URL
37:14
is future assist. So, we'll plug this in here.
37:21
Let's see if they have a guarantee. Service guarantee. Yeah. Okay. So, it
37:35
looks like there's something here. Let's have a look.
37:38
Explore our unique difference while we offer no charge initial consultation
37:44
consultation. All right, let's see.
37:56
Provide industry-leading service backed by our communication service guarantee.
38:04
All right. Well, we're going to find out what that is.
38:08
But it doesn't sound very strong. Um, scarcity
38:13
none, right? Um, we'll just bold these. Now,
38:19
let's go back. So, we'll close these. Now, we've got this is somebody that
38:31
financial planner. It's a university and they're bidding on it, offering a
38:34
postgrad financial planning. We're not going to click on that. And then we've
38:37
got this one, financial planner, f first financial Melbourne. And you can also
38:44
scroll down here and there'll typically be like another three or four ads down
38:48
the bottom where we can also have a look at if this next person
38:53
doesn't have any activity on them. So let's have a look. This is their landing
38:57
page. Retire life ready. So this is the first one that's even got a headline of
39:03
some description. At First Financial, our passion is to help Australians
39:07
retire when and how they choose with confidence and certainty. Are you ready
39:12
to start building wealth? Are you on the countdown to retirement?
39:17
Okay, some testimonials. So, they're trying to profile me in to
39:22
two different things. We'll see where they do. Request a free consultation.
39:27
Okay, that's their CTA. Why we are different? Unique investment
39:37
strategy. First financial stories and articles.
39:41
Get in touch if you want to retire life ready. I don't know what that means.
39:46
Retiring life ready. It doesn't mean a great deal to me to be honest. Request
39:51
free consultation. So what we do here is This client's name is First Financial.
40:17
We'll bold it. Now these people did not again it did
40:24
not appear that they have any high value content offer. There's no content
40:32
up for offer here, right? Um they just want me to speak to a salesperson
40:38
immediately, which is quite a threatening offer. Um
40:43
all right. No, nope. They don't they don't have any of that. Okay. So nothing
40:50
like do you see like just from doing this that you know nobody is even doing
40:56
the very surface level stuff that we've gone over so far. Um there's no one that
41:00
has a highv value content offer. They're just going straight for the jugular and
41:05
trying to make a sale straight out the gate and to speak with a salesperson. Um
41:10
which is just a failing strategy. Now, let's have a look and see if we've
41:16
got any data on them and their traffic. Okay, so from their domain analysis on
41:26
these guys, let's see if we've got paid we've got organic search data. Do we
41:30
have any paid search data? It does not appear that we do. So,
41:36
typically when you see somebody that's like at the very bottom like this and
41:40
their ad is just so bare bones, they're probably spending very little, like
41:44
maybe a,000 bucks a month. And typically, SCM Rush or any of these
41:48
platforms will not bring it up that is that little, right? So, when you click
41:52
on advertising research, there's just there's no activity. There's nothing
41:56
going on here. Um there's just not enough for for them to bring up. So
42:02
what we will do before we commit to including these people as a competitor
42:08
like they're definitely getting some organic traffic and some traction here.
42:11
First financial financial management. Um let's go back to Google and let's have a
42:17
quick look at one or two of these people. So we'll take this one
42:23
here. And all I want to know before I dive in
42:32
specifically to this person is if they're going to have any other data for
42:38
us to take a look at. Nope. Doesn't look like there's much activity for them
42:41
either. So we can just go off this people. Um so then taking a look at
42:46
this. What else do we have here? We know from ourselves because we've
42:52
seen it that they're they're doing Google. Um, let's see if there's any
42:57
activity on Similar Web. I would hazard a guess we're not going to be able to
43:01
find anything. Typically, SCM Rush can't find anything. It, you know, you can't
43:06
find anything on Similar Web because there's not enough activity. Sorry, I
43:12
put the wrong one in there. Let's see. Yeah, there's nothing on
43:19
here. Right. So we we just have to look from from our own means in terms of we
43:23
we know that they're only running essentially Google from what we can see.
43:28
Um we know that they're they have some organic rankings and they do have you
43:32
know they are bidding on few keywords but we can't find out exactly what those
43:36
keywords are. Right? So we're just going to say Google for these guys and we
43:39
can't find any of the other stuff. We know the URL it's that.
43:45
Let's say they have a guarantee. Sorry. You have to get rid of this
44:05
information at the start of the domain name in order to get it to come up.
44:14
And it would help if I put G in there. Nothing. No guarantee here.
44:24
Let's take a quick look. No, nothing. Um, and it's very typical
44:32
for these people not to have any guarantees.
44:38
Let's put none. And nothing. There was no scarcity.
44:44
Right. What we will do, however, I can pretty
44:48
much certain say that there's not going to be any activity on here.
44:55
We'll see if they're running any ads. Oh, I am wrong. We have an ad. So, this
45:01
is the ad that basically that they're running on Facebook. They've got these
45:04
two different ads. U gender pay gaps and lower superanuation balances partner
45:09
with longer life expectancy are some of the challenges facing women and their
45:13
financial future. At First Financial, we help you implement strategies to help
45:17
maximize your personal wealth and secure. And we've got this lady here.
45:21
Are you in control of your financial future?
45:26
Then what we can do is we can click on the ad here and we can click on the link
45:31
and we can go through to the landing page. So, they're running this to a
45:35
women's wealth landing page. Yeah. So, now we come back to this and
45:41
we know that they're also running Facebook ads,
45:47
right? And you can basically take this, where am I? Over here. And you can
45:56
create a a Google sheet and just put it in there. Um, and actually download
46:00
their and save this URL. What we will do is we'll go and have a look at the other
46:05
ad that they're running. Worried about making investment mistakes. Do you feel
46:09
like you aren't making the most out of your opportunities? Let's have a look at
46:12
this one. This one is a contact us. Let's see where they're running this to.
46:18
Common investment mistakes. Okay, so we've got some content here.
46:23
Um, so it looks like we've got a video. Financial experts used to think that.
46:31
Yeah. So that's kind of like their their little content piece, but again they're
46:35
not capturing any details or anything like that. Um you can save this. So what
46:40
what we do know about them is they're running Google ads, they're running
46:43
Facebook. Um they don't have any guarantee or no scarcity. So th this is
46:48
just already like we we've got a very surface level understanding of what's
46:53
happening on the top. We can download all the ads. We've got their ad copy. We
46:56
know exactly what's going on from that point of view. Um, and then with
47:00
depending on what market that you operate in, there can be a lot more data
47:05
to kind of dig through from both Similm and SEM Rush and even Facebook ads. Um,
47:10
you can find like, you know, sometimes people have got hundreds and hundreds of
47:13
ads that are running on Facebook and whatnot. And they're running multiple
47:16
different URLs. It just depends on how sophisticated that market is. But, you
47:21
know, this is essentially what I've never done it for these people before.
47:24
I'm just randomly picked them out of the hat and this is basically what we've
47:27
got, right? and you just never know how much data that you're going to get. You
47:32
just have to go with really what you've got.
47:35
And so once you've used both SEM Rush and you know Facebook ads library tool
47:41
and similar web, these are great places to as I said get that data and to find
47:47
their URLs and to find out what they're doing. And because you know it's
47:50
service-based businesses typically they're not going to have their prices
47:53
on their landing pages. sometimes that they do and they include like different
47:57
packages or whatnot. Um, but more or less this is kind of the the very first
48:03
half of really diving in and seeing what the competitors are doing and what
48:07
landing pages that they're sending traffic to and all of that kind of
48:10
stuff. Um, but you can see from this market that they're just not a very
48:14
sophisticated crowd and there's not a lot going on. There's no, you know,
48:19
highv value content offers or funnels or webinars or anything like that. It's
48:23
just like, "Speak with our sales team." Everybody, look at the three different
48:27
calls to action here. Request a chat, request a free chat, and request a free
48:31
consultation. They're all saying the same thing in a different way. Um, so
48:35
immediately we know that we do not want to have that as our offer. Not that we
48:39
ever would um because it's just vanilla and lackluster, but immediately you get
48:44
some transparency to to what's going on. So, let's go back here. And now what
48:51
we're going to discuss is basically getting comp like an X-ray competitive
48:56
intelligence. So what you can see what we've just touched on is really just the
49:01
tip of the iceberg. And there's only so much information that we're able to get
49:06
from just looking through what are the keywords that they're targeting on,
49:09
downloading all of their ads, downloading all their landing pages,
49:13
studying those, then having a look at where they're getting their traffic
49:16
from, looking at their Facebook ads, downloading their Facebook ads by taking
49:20
screenshots, saving the URLs. You know, that's just like the very top of like,
49:26
you know, what does somebody's salesunnel looks like? Now, what we want
49:29
to do is we want to do X-ray competitive intelligence. And the way that we do
49:33
that with these companies is we're going to have to fill out their those forms on
49:38
their website and we're going to have to request a free chat and we're going to
49:42
have to shop these people and we're going to find out exactly, you know,
49:46
we're going to ask to get their proposals and we're going to start to
49:50
see what's going on. And that way we can fill out the rest of the competitor like
49:56
mapping, offer mapping where we can put in, we can ask them, okay, well, how
50:00
much do you guys charge? You know, what's the the the rough retainer? How
50:04
does it work? Do you have any other further information that you can send
50:07
me? Do you have a proposal? You know, they might try to push for a
50:12
face-to-face appointment. If they do, go in there. Go in and see them. Right?
50:16
These are the things that you need to do if you want to win. You need to operate.
50:21
You need to know exactly what your competitors are saying to your prospects
50:26
and your potential clients so you can really set the criteria of what's being
50:31
discussed and what's important. So you want to call them. You want to see, you
50:36
know, their whole process from the moment that you call them. Do you speak
50:39
with a receptionist? Does that receptionist put you through to a member
50:43
of their sales team? Do they put to someone that further qualifies you
50:46
further? Do you have to book an appointment? How long does it take to
50:50
book an appointment? Because that will determine, you know, how busy they are
50:54
and what the activity is that that they've got going on. Ask them for some
50:58
information and some collateral, pricing, any testimonials that they've
51:03
got, you know, is there any information that they can give you about the
51:07
services they offer and start to collect this stuff, right? And this is something
51:12
like you don't just fill out that form and then see what they say. You fill out
51:16
the form. You call their phone number. You speak to a rep. You go into their to
51:21
their office. You meet with them. You get pricing. You see what their sales
51:26
process is like. And you map it all out. And you find out like based on, you
51:32
know, you're seeing at the very very top and going, "Okay, this keyword, this
51:35
this competitor has 20,000 organic keywords. You know, they've got 30 paid.
51:41
They're getting 1.5,000 visits from paid. Then they've also got Facebook
51:45
ads. These are the landing pages that they're running. Then you fill out their
51:48
form and you see what their process is like. You get their proposal, their
51:52
collateral, their pricing, and all of those things. And then and only then do
51:59
you start to begin to understand who do you think is doing very well? Um and and
52:05
who are the people that are dominating the market? Who are the people that are
52:07
aggressive? Who are the most aggressive in their advertising? What offers work?
52:12
What's going on? on what their sales process is. And this is something that
52:17
you really need to do. And most people like they're like, "Oh, how am I going
52:21
to do that? What do you mean how are you going to do that? You're just going to
52:24
fill out their form and you're going to speak to them, right?" And you might be
52:29
thinking like, "Oh, this is dishonest or this is a bit confrontational or any of
52:33
that stuff like that." Like, you know, at the end of the day, you know,
52:36
business is war and you need to know what the enemy is doing. You need to
52:41
know exactly and get the intel and and find out what is going on. Why do you
52:46
think all of these countries have like international spies that are posted up
52:50
in all of these countries and collecting intel? It's because it's incredibly
52:54
important, you know, when you go to battle. And that's what we're doing. We
52:57
are going to war with these other competitors. And we want to win that
53:01
war. And we want to do that by knowing them better than they know us and by
53:05
knowing exactly what's going on in that marketplace. So, you know, that's the
53:10
steps that you want to go through on this on the on the X-ray competitive
53:13
intelligence. Do not skip this step. You will lose if you do. You need to know
53:17
and you need to speak with their reps. You need to fill out their forms and see
53:22
what the email auto reply is. You need to speak with their receptionist. You
53:25
need to speak with the sales team. And then you can come back to that offer
53:29
mapping spreadsheet and start to fill out like their price. Do they have any
53:33
scarcity? Is there any payment plans that they offer? Is it a contract? All
53:38
of those kind of stuff. We want to know everything in forensic like detail.
53:44
Then the next step is what I call buying the golden feeasant. And you you may
53:50
guess what this is and that means becoming an actual client or a customer
53:56
or buying some of their services, right? or buying one of their products or
54:00
paying for a seminar or paying for a consultation just to understand. I'm not
54:06
expecting you to create some fake company and sign up for a contract with
54:11
someone. That's a little bit ownorous. Um, but I'm talking about, you know, if
54:15
they've got a paid consultation, you better pay for that and you better go
54:19
and do it and you better pretend like you are a client. If they've got any
54:23
products or any books, buy those things, right? You know, you need to shop the
54:29
competition. You just It's an absolute vital thing to do. And not only do you
54:35
need to do it to find out what their selling process is, but you need to do
54:39
it to then make sure that the service that you're delivering or the product
54:43
that you're selling is 10 times better than what everybody else in the
54:49
marketplace is offering. Right? It's just an absolute necessity. And it's
54:54
definitely more difficult in a service-based business, but you know,
54:59
typically people will have, you know, a very low entry level. And you might be
55:04
thinking, "Oh, I'm going to have to pay $500 or $1,000 or $2,000 for that." What
55:10
is it worth to you to be the number one player in your market?
55:15
What is it worth for you to have a firm dominant grip of all of the competition
55:20
and know exactly what they're doing and know exactly what their onboarding
55:24
procedures are and how they deliver their service and how they price it and
55:28
how they structure it and where they get their leads from and all of these
55:31
things, right? And the the answer for that is it is priceless, right? This is
55:39
the intel that you need to win. So, just go out there and get it, right? I don't
55:43
really care if that makes you feel uncomfortable. It's a necessary step in
55:47
order to win. And really, that's what I am here to help you to do. I am here to
55:52
help you win. And I help you to help you scale your business up and really
55:56
achieve things that you only ever dreamed of achieving. And in order to
56:00
achieve those things that you've never achieved, you are going to need to do
56:04
things that you've never done. And if this is something that you never have
56:08
never done, then that is a telltale sign that this is exactly the thing that you
56:12
must do, right? And I'm only telling you things that I know work, right? This is
56:17
just absolute golden wisdom. And you may have heard it before. You may have
56:22
thought about it. You may have even toyed with the idea of doing it. But I'm
56:26
telling you that you absolutely must do it. You must go out there and shop the
56:30
top three competitors in the space of people that are most aggressively
56:34
advertising. and know exactly what it is that they're doing. Getting proposals
56:39
and then looking to at least buy off one or two of them in in some regard.
56:45
Whether it's a consultation or it's their lowest level product or it's a
56:50
book or it's a seminar, whatever it is, you need to go ahead and actually buy
56:54
that to really get a really intimate understanding of what's going on. And
56:59
the reason that I call it buying the golden pheasant is because it's like
57:03
that is the thing that's going to lay the egg for you over and over and over.
57:08
And if you know exactly what's working and what's been working for your
57:11
competitors, we know that some of these people have been running paid
57:14
advertising for the last 10 years, right? And if somebody does that, they
57:18
don't do it because they just like to spend money. They do it because it's
57:21
working. And if it's working, that means that it's a combination of what they
57:26
have got in terms of on their ads in their landing pages and then what's
57:30
going on after they generate that lead post lead generation and they're
57:35
actually making enough money to pay for the advertising costs and then to pay
57:40
for their business and their all their overheads and their employees and all of
57:43
their salaries. So, it's a telltale sign that what they're doing is working. And
57:48
then what we're going to do is we're going to find out what is working for
57:52
the top three people. And then we're going to do something that is 10 times
57:56
better than what they're doing. So we can crush them into a fine powder that
58:01
just scatters in the wind and we become the number one apex predator in that
58:06
market. Okay? And that's exactly what it takes in order to achieve that. So the
58:11
resources, you know, for this module is really that competitor um offer mapping
58:17
and just going through and having a look at what all the competitors are doing,
58:20
mapping out their offers, running through, filling it all down. And it
58:23
really, you know, we could only do the top half of this um today because the
58:28
other stuff involves us getting on the telephone with these people and shopping
58:31
them and buying them and getting their proposals and doing that. So you'll have
58:34
to go out there and do that in your marketplace. Then once we have that
58:39
right then what we are going to do is this next step is when we are we are
58:45
striking like lightning because we're going to be really intimately
58:50
understanding what everybody's doing and then once we've intimately understood
58:54
what everybody is doing we are then going to do something that is one
59:00
different and that is 10 times better than what they're doing. So, for
59:05
instance, we saw that these people, none of them have a highv value content offer
59:09
and they're missing out on 97% of their market straight out the gate in terms of
59:13
the amount of leads that they could be generating because they're pushing
59:16
everybody into a consult. But, as we saw in the larger market formula, we all we
59:21
already know that only a very small subset of that market is ever going to
59:26
be ready to actually speak to a salesperson. And it's a very threatening
59:30
thing, right, to have this saleserson call them up and try to sell them some
59:34
stuff as opposed to is just downloading a high-value content offer and reading
59:40
at your own leisure and then providing some value to that marketplace. Like
59:44
hiring a financial planner is no joke. Like you have to show these people how
59:47
much money that you're making. You give them access to your accounts. You show
59:51
them, you know, what's going on in in in your marriage financially. Like it's a
59:56
very intimate thing. Like to go and just ask somebody to give you that
1:00:00
information on one of those consults straight out the gate is just a very
1:00:03
unnatural progression. Yet that's what everybody in that marketplace is doing
1:00:07
and it's still working. So we want to really be standing our head and
1:00:12
shoulders above what all of our competitors are doing. And the very
1:00:15
first step that we do that in is one in our ads and having our ad copy and
1:00:21
saying different things in all of our ad copy which we'll be getting to later in
1:00:25
this course. Um and the first thing is then again secondary is looking at the
1:00:30
highv value content offer and offering an offer that nobody else is doing. No
1:00:35
one else is doing that. So the cut through that we're going to get is
1:00:37
infinitely more. We saw that all those three competitors they all have the same
1:00:42
offer. It's all exactly the same. request a free consultation. Right? So
1:00:46
then how how do you stand out as somebody different when everybody's
1:00:50
saying the same thing? Like you just you do something different, you're going to
1:00:52
get a dramatic different result and you're going to stand out straight from
1:00:56
the get-go. And then what we want to do that's just the marketing piece, right?
1:01:02
And there's a lot that we can said and that we will be saying about that and
1:01:07
diving into. But then what you want to do, this is how you really win. This is
1:01:12
how you really just completely get a strangle hold of your entire market is
1:01:18
you create a better service than all of those people and then you market it far
1:01:23
more aggressively than all of those people because then not only are you
1:01:27
you've basically got way better marketing, everything's so much better,
1:01:32
but then you've got a way better service or a product, right, that you're that
1:01:35
you're selling that's just way better than anything. And then you get more
1:01:39
happy customers and you get more reviews than anybody. And it's like a flywheel
1:01:43
that just spins itself and it starts to accelerate because you're going out
1:01:47
there, you're getting the most customers, then you're providing the
1:01:49
best service to them, then you're getting the most reviews and then that's
1:01:52
going to help with your conversions, right? So, it's like a flywheel and it
1:01:56
just adds to themselves. But what most people do is that they just look and
1:02:02
they funnel hack what people are doing on their marketing and then they stop
1:02:05
there and they don't see what they're actually doing on the back end and their
1:02:08
service delivery and then go out there and create a way better product or
1:02:12
service. That's really how you get a strangle hold. And that's definitely
1:02:16
what I'm encouraging you to do. It requires work, but it's going to result
1:02:20
in you being the dominant player in your industry. And as I said before, that is
1:02:25
certainly something that is priceless. Now, I'll leave you with this quote by
1:02:30
Sunzu. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night. And when you
1:02:36
move, fall like a thunderbolt. Right? You want to plan this stuff in private.
1:02:41
You know, this is not something you want to talk about with anybody else outside
1:02:45
of your business or really within anyone in your business. It's something that
1:02:48
you want to do privately. really get an understand firm grip of what everybody's
1:02:53
doing and then form your battle plan and then just fall like a thunderbolt and
1:02:58
attack and just dominate your market. And that if you follow this formula and
1:03:02
you do exactly what I'm telling you to do in this module, this is really an
1:03:08
incredibly powerful and an incredibly profound thing to do in your business.
1:03:13
And the results that you get for this will literally serve you for your entire
1:03:18
business career. If you can get good at doing this, it doesn't matter what your
1:03:22
new offers that you create or what markets that you choose to enter in
1:03:26
enter into, you will always dominate. So the action items for today's video is
1:03:32
funnel hack the competition. At least pick three to four competitors, put them
1:03:36
on your funnel um your your competitor's offer map and then basically start to
1:03:40
speak with their sales team, right? speak with them, get their proposals,
1:03:44
get their collateral, attend a face-to-face meeting, see what the next
1:03:48
step is that they're pushing for on that initial phone call, and whatever it is,
1:03:53
do it. And then map out their offers using our um competitor offer mapping
1:03:58
spreadsheet. Fill all of that in as much detail as possible. Then also what you
1:04:03
want to do with that is create that folder on your computer and have
1:04:06
download all of their ads, download all their landing pages, download all of the
1:04:10
keywords that they're targeting and keep them in there for reference and then buy
1:04:15
their products and services. Right? This is a crucial step. Do not do the top
1:04:20
three without doing this. This is an absolute must. Buy their products and
1:04:24
services and see what it is that they offer, how they deliver it. You know
1:04:30
what is there a payment plan? see all of those different mechanics. A lot of this
1:04:33
stuff you can only see by pulling out your credit card and not being afraid to
1:04:38
spend money with your competition. Don't like people think, "Oh, I don't want to
1:04:42
go and give my competitors money." Why not, right? It's a Trojan horse that
1:04:46
you're setting in there and you're finding out what's going on and then
1:04:49
you're going to win. And that's the thing that we care about. We care about
1:04:52
winning. Um, and then lastly is build a better
1:04:56
product or service and an offer to what they're doing. So don't just look at the
1:05:01
offer and don't just think I'm just going to do better marketing, but use
1:05:05
that product or service that you bought and think, how can I make this 10 times
1:05:10
better? Where are the holes in this? How do I plug those holes? And when you buy
1:05:14
a few different competitors, you know, products or services, then you really
1:05:18
see like where the gap is in your market and where you can go out and really
1:05:22
dominate. So that pretty much brings us to the end of of this module. I hope you
1:05:27
got a lot out of it. You've got a lot of work to do. So, get to work and I will
1:05:31
see you in the next video.

Power Guarantees


Market Slaughtering Power Guarantees
In any given transaction between two parties, there will always be risk present. In most
cases, one side will be asked to assume the burden of this risk, and more often than
not, it’s generally the buyer, and not the seller.
A power guarantee’s goal is to remove any last bit of friction that stands in the way of
your prospect buying. Think about your guarantee as a proof element to your overall
offer – proof of how confident you are about delivering on every promise your offer
makes.
The primary function of your guarantee is to make your prospect feel safe and secure
that they’ll get everything you’ve promised them or their money back.


7 Steps To Creating A Power Guarantee
Ok, let’s get busy: here’s a step-by-step method for creating your power guarantee (or
pumping up an existing one on steroids) and using it to supercharge your marketing
efforts.


1. Study the competition
Do a Google search for other businesses in your industry and the word ‘guarantee’.
Then take it one step further and have someone call and ask them about their
guarantee. Look outside of your industry or geography for solid guarantees. Write
them down. Go deep in your search. What trends do you see? Do many companies in
your industry offer guarantees? What type of guarantees did you find? Did you find
any specific performance-related guarantees or were they the more common,
lacklustre vanilla ‘satisfaction guaranteed’ type?


2. Laser in on your strengths
What area of your business is a strong point for you? Do you get results quickly? Do
you have exceptional craftsmanship? Do you do very fast installations? Are you great
at maintenance? Do your products or services produce consistently outstanding
results? Do you save money or time for your customers? Always sell the thing you do
better than your competition.

3. Be specific
Think about the specific results a customer wants, or the problem they’re trying to
solve when they buy your products or services.
Your guarantee should be specific, not some vague notion of ‘satisfaction’.
Satisfaction is too broad. Make a specific promise and tell your prospects they must
experience the benefits you’re promising – otherwise they don’t owe you a red cent.
What good things happen when a client uses your products or services? Better sleep?
More money? Lose weight? Reduced stress? Write down the answer in detail and
then guarantee that outcome. Do not simply guarantee ‘satisfaction’. Guarantee in
detail what that satisfaction will look like to your customer and make it
measurable.


4. Choose a payback
As unlikely as it is that you’ll be making good on your guarantee (remember, fewer
than 5% of customers will ever take you up on it), you want to create an attractive
payback in case a customer is unsatisfied. Ideally, it won’t cost you much but will have
a high perceived value, and alleviate and remove the perceived risk around the
purchase. Your guarantee should exceed customer expectations, be memorable, and
wow them.


5. Test, measure, and refine
It’s vitally important that you know how well your guarantee is performing before you
make it a core element of your offer. How? You can include it on some landing pages
and not others, or different advertising channels such as Google, Facebook,
YouTube, or Instagram. Then track the results and test, measure, and refine it until it’s
really power packed and pulling in sales.
Pinpoint how much sales have grown over the same period last year or the period
before you had a guarantee. Be sure to test at least two combinations of your
guarantee to find the one that pulls in the most sales. You might guarantee results for
30 days in one test and 90 days in another (longer guarantees generally work better).
You might even use a ten-year or, better yet, a lifetime guarantee as an experiment!


6. Put it front and centre
Once you’ve tested, measured, and refined your guarantee and found a winner that’s
pulling its head off, put your guarantee in writing and place it front and centre of all

your marketing and public relations. Put it on your website, landing pages, proposals,
in your ads, your brochures – anywhere a customer will see it.


7. Give your guarantee a name
While this isn’t mandatory, giving your guarantee a unique name can dramatise it and
heighten its impact. Here are just a handful of examples to get your creative juices
flowing:
• 100% Money-Back Guarantee
• My 100% Money-Back ‘Triple-Protection’ Guarantee
• Take it to the Bank!
• Better than Risk-Free
• You Can’t Lose
• Unconditional, Money-Back Guarantee
• Your Money-Back, No Questions Asked
• I Personally Guarantee
• No Way You Can Lose
• 30-Day Free Examination
• No-Questions, No-Quibbles, Money-Back Guarantee
• Iron-Clad Money-Back Guarantee
• 100% On-the-Spot Full Refund
• My 110% ‘Call Me Crazy’ GUARANTEE!
• Absolutely No Risk to You!
• 100% No-Hassle Refund!
• My 110%, No-Fuss, No-Questions, ‘Take-It-or-Leave- It’ PROMISE!
• No Pussyfooting Around and Get Every Cent Back GUARANTEE!
• Stronger than Steel No-Risk Money-Back Guarantee


Here Are Some Industry-Defining Guarantee Examples:
The Forever Guarantee: If at any time you are not completely satisfied with the
performance of your Cutco Product, we will correct the problem or replace it.

The $1 Million Service Guarantee: LifeLock works to help stop identity theft before it
happens by taking proactive steps to reduce your risk. But if you become a victim of
identity theft while you are a LifeLock member because of some failure or defect in our
service, contact us and we will act on your behalf to repair any damage. We will spend
up to $1 million to hire lawyers, investigators, consultants, and whatever else it takes
to restore your name and help you recover the direct losses from the identity theft.
Domino’s Pizza: Your pizza will be delivered in 30 minutes... or it’s FREE!
Costco: 100% satisfaction guaranteed. We guarantee your satisfaction on every
product we sell with a full refund. We will refund your membership fee ($55) in full at
any time if you are dissatisfied.
With the seven practical steps you now hold in your hands, every guarantee you write
should suck in sales like never before. Each step in this process is easy to apply,
especially if you use one of the many examples I’ve provided as a template and adapt
it to your own product or service. A strong guarantee puts your prospect at ease and
makes it easier for them to say ‘Yes!’
Follow these steps and do them well... then craft an irresistible Godfather Offer and
throw that on top... and you’ve got a money-multiplying formula for wealth in virtually
any industry.
Now get to it!


Action Points
● You create a FEATURE LIST.
● You create a BENEFIT LIST.
● You reduce your OFFER to writing.
● Make it irresistible
● Offer a POWER GUARANTEE.

Hey guys, Sabri Subie here and welcome to this module of quantum growth called
0:16
the godfather strategy. And this is the single most powerful, most effective and
0:23
most profitgenerating strategy that I have ever discovered. This is one of the
0:28
secrets that I've been reluctant to reveal because it's unquestionably the
0:33
biggest secret that I have uncovered over the last 17 years in the trenches
0:37
of sales and marketing. And this secret is so powerful that it instantly
0:41
doubles, triples, or even quadruples the profit of almost any sales message
0:48
selling any product or service in any market. And it can make the weakest and
0:54
most unprofitable traffic sources that you've just struggled to get working and
0:59
then turn those into your own little personal honeypot of the most ravenous
1:04
and itchy to buy customers available. And it's really my secret weapon. And
1:08
it's allowed me to invade and conquer multiple industries in multiple
1:14
different markets with multiple different businesses and crush much more
1:18
established competitors into a fine powder that just scatters in the wind.
1:23
So before we get stuck straight into the specifics of exactly what the Godfather
1:28
strategy is, let's have a look at what we'll be covering in today's module. So
1:32
we'll be going over the Godfather Strategy. We'll be going over the seven
1:36
parts of what make up like the framework for a godfather offer. Then preframing
1:42
and obliterating objections and a market slaughtering power guarantee as well. So
1:48
first of all the godfather strategy right and that is all around making your
1:53
prospects an offer that they can't refuse. An offer really consists of two
1:59
things. And that is what your prospect wants when they respond to your
2:03
marketing and what they have to do in order to get that thing. And it's where
2:09
99% of businesses really get it wrong because they generate leads or if
2:14
they've got their head screwed on right, they offer a free report and then
2:17
they're surprised, right, when people don't show up at the door with a credit
2:22
card or just whip out their wallet and buy straight away. And that's because
2:27
they're not motivating their prospects with an irresistible offer. Less than 1%
2:32
of the businesses that I have ever consulted with, and I've consulted with
2:36
thousands, ever have this right before, you know, I really work with them and
2:40
look at their business and they don't have any resemblance of an irresistible
2:44
offer. Instead, they are using resistable offers and then they wonder
2:50
why their business is stuck and they can't get paid advertising to work. And
2:54
it's literally they're just walking around with an offer that everybody can
2:59
resist. And the Godfather strategy is the polar opposite. It's about making an
3:05
irresistible offer with balls, right? It's about making some huge claims and
3:10
some big promises. And it's about having an offer so white hot that it melts
3:16
objections and obliterates any friction between you and the sale and almost
3:22
forces your prospects to buy because you're just stacking it in a way where
3:26
it's so irresistible. Now, sadly, what I see all the time is
3:32
that most business owners start like they start in a position of incredible
3:36
weakness and their promises are weak and they're watered down and they're vanilla
3:42
and they have no resemblance at all of what a compelling offer looks like.
3:47
Instead, they have an impotent offer that looks something like this, right?
3:52
It's like use our service and you might see some sort of vague benefit sometime
3:58
in the distant future, right? Or download this free report and we'll tell
4:04
you how great it is to have our products and services. These are just horrible.
4:09
They're weak and they're frail and they're simply not good enough to
4:13
withstand the competitive gale force winds that rage through the online
4:19
marketplace. Right? it just is not going to be it's not going to cut the mustard
4:23
so to speak. Now here is how you create a hairraising offer that stops your
4:29
prospects in their tracks and demands their attention and practically forces
4:34
them to buy. So you know if you don't have a drink or a tea with you or a cup
4:38
of coffee, go grab one of those. Get comfortable because unless your offers
4:43
are already radically different from the tens of thousands of businesses that
4:47
I've seen, we're about to add big bucks to your bottom line with this module.
4:51
This thing is the real deal. So really, when I think about the
4:57
Godfather strategy, and if I had to kind of summarize it down to just one
5:02
strategy or one key component that makes it up, it's really to sell what people
5:08
want to buy, right? It's as simple as that. And that might sound elementary,
5:13
but you wouldn't believe how many supposedly smart university educated
5:19
people in business don't understand this. They start by looking at what they
5:24
would like to buy and not what their market wants, what is irresistible to
5:28
their market. Right? They swim against the raging river that is the desires of
5:33
their marketplace. And they begin with their own interests in mind. and they
5:37
ask what would I like to sell or what is convenient for me to sell or what do I
5:42
think would be a cool gizmo or service right and that is completely the wrong
5:47
place to start they don't ask what is my market absolutely starving for what are
5:54
they willing to crawl on their knees across like crushed glass in order to
6:00
get their hands on right what would be an offer so good that would take someone
6:05
that is like, you know, on their couch lethargic in the middle of winter in a
6:10
snowstorm outside while they're watching their best and most favorite television
6:14
show on Netflix. What would get them to stop that and get up out of their couch,
6:19
go outside and walk 5 kilometers in the blistering cold snow in order to get
6:24
this? And that's really the point and the position that you want to start
6:28
from. And that really comes down to this
6:32
concept. And that concept is about finding the bullseye. Finding the
6:38
absolute perfect bullseye that will set your prospects on fire that will
6:44
absolutely get that person and your dream buyer to take out their credit
6:48
card and take action irrationally, emotionally, and rapidly. Right? There
6:53
is a bullseye in every market. And it doesn't matter if you shoot it with a
6:57
sniper rifle or a rubber mallet. Right? If you hit this thing, the response will
7:03
be on will be beyond your wildest dreams because there is that bullseye. And
7:08
look, you know, basically knowing this and having the ability to find the
7:13
bullseye, it has allowed me to wipe the [ __ ] floor with some of the best
7:19
copywriters in the world and dwarf their numbers because I know how to hit the
7:23
bullseye. I've gone up against many top copywriters from some of the best direct
7:28
response marketing companies in the world, right? And have beat the pants
7:32
off these guys because my ability to find the bullseye in any market and
7:36
shoot a laser beam right through it and shatter that target into thousands of
7:41
pieces is what has allowed me to do that. And
7:45
once you've done your research using the Halo strategy and have discovered what
7:49
people really want in your market, then you need to sell it to them, right? So
7:56
keep in mind that sometimes you can have the right crowd at the wrong time. You
7:59
could be offering the best hamburgers in the world, but if you're trying to sell
8:03
those hamburgers to a crowd that has just finished like a seven course
8:07
deastation meal at a beautiful restaurant, then you're not going to
8:11
have many customers, right? So, if through this process that you uncover
8:16
that what it is that you are selling isn't indeed what your market is
8:20
starving for, then do not try and put lipstick on a pig. Right? That is do not
8:27
try and dress up what you're selling as being what it is that they want and then
8:31
try to fool your marketplace or even fool yourself. Right? Don't try and
8:37
reason with or convince yourself that what you're selling is good enough.
8:42
like, you know, yeah, it's good enough. I managed to sell a few. That's not what
8:45
is going to get you absolute breakthrough results, right? Good enough
8:49
is not going to cut it. Simply do what's required in order to pivot your business
8:55
to align with what your market desires most. Fire employees, get rid of
9:01
departments, sell the rema remainer of stock that you've got sitting in a
9:04
warehouse, whatever it is, do it. Do not fogg a dead horse, so to speak. Right?
9:09
This is absolutely crucial. It does not matter about all the other stuff that
9:14
I'm telling you if you're just selling something that your market doesn't work.
9:18
There's no amount of copy that's ever going to change that, right? You really
9:22
need to understand this key key crucial component here. This is really something
9:28
that I cannot stress the importance of enough. And you know, master level
9:33
business builders, they start with the bullseye of a market and then they work
9:37
backwards from that point to create or to engineer a product or service that
9:42
hits the bullseye dead in the center, right? You know, and the thing is that
9:49
you might be thinking like it's really inconvenient for me to do that or it's
9:52
going to cost me a lot of money. What I can tell you is that enduring the
9:56
short-term hardship, loss or discomfort of actually addressing this and making
10:01
sure that you are selling something that your market is starving starving for
10:05
will save you a lot of pain and you know lost profits in the long term, right?
10:13
And you really want to take some of that short-term hardship in order to avoid
10:17
that long-term extreme just pain that's going to be dragged out, right? So most
10:23
business owners and entrepreneurs spend tens of thousands of dollars developing
10:29
a product or service before they've done a deep dive into the market research to
10:33
put together their offer or their sales message. Then right once they've done
10:39
that then they try and mold their sales pitch to fit what product or service can
10:45
actually do. Right? So that they like deliver this pro that they create this
10:49
product and then they write their sales letter or their webinar or whatever it
10:53
is, right? The the selling mechanism that's going to be selling and they try
10:56
to mold that product or service like into the sales message about what it can
11:01
actually do, right? Removing this claim or this promise or that benefit cuz it
11:05
doesn't do that. And ultimately they castrate their sales message from the
11:10
get-go because they've gone about it in the wrong way. And the right way to
11:14
approach it is to write your sales message before ever creating the product
11:19
or service. Right? Make the biggest claims. Give the market what they are
11:25
starving for. Create the dream come true experience for that market. And then and
11:30
only then start to develop the product or service to deliver on all those
11:35
claims and promises and that dream come true experience for your dream prospect.
11:41
Right? So moving on, once you know what your
11:45
market is starving for, then you take your product or service and you craft it
11:50
into a compell compelling sales pitch, an offer that they simply can't refuse.
11:55
And here's how you do it, right? So you take all the data that we collected from
12:00
the Halo strategy and then you create what is called a detail sheet, right?
12:05
That basically has the features and the benefits. Again, I'm referring to that
12:09
Halo strategy worksheet because as I said, that is the raw materials. That is
12:14
everything. Everything that we do is always centered around the prospect and
12:20
around the customer and client. Okay. So, what we do is we create a detail
12:26
sheet um about the product or services that you want to sell. And on this
12:30
sheet, you'll have two columns. Column one should be titled features. And this
12:35
is where you list all the different full list of features of what you're selling.
12:38
Like make it really really extensive. Um and I've created just a basic one of
12:43
these fe these detail sheets for you which you can find a link to in the
12:47
resources section. Right? Then the second column should will be titled
12:51
benefits. And this is a column where you convert all the features into
12:55
corresponding benefits. Right? And don't discount the importance of this. Right?
12:59
You might be I know about like features and benefits sub like why are we doing
13:02
this? Right? I know it sounds simple, but while this might sound very simple,
13:07
if you do this exercise correctly and you document it and you do a really good
13:12
job on your research, your offers will almost write themselves because we're
13:15
just giving the market exactly what they want and the benefits that they're
13:18
seeking. But what another disclaimer for this is
13:23
like, you know, when I'm mentioning these things, you might be thinking like
13:27
this is elementary or I've I've done something that resembles this in the
13:31
past. Like please, please, please ensure that you take a lot of time when you do
13:36
this. Really sweat over it. Like most amateur marketers and rookie
13:41
copywriters, they don't do this step at all. Right? And even most of the top
13:45
copywriters, they don't labor over this stuff nearly long enough. And if you
13:51
really look at the absolute killer marketers, killer copywriters, these
13:57
people say the difference is really in the research. And that's really what
14:00
we're doing right now is where we've done the research and now we're really
14:05
getting clear on what we're going to do with that research. So like do this
14:09
stuff right? Do not question me. Do it. I promise you the benefits that you get
14:13
from this will really really be profound. Now you should really list
14:19
every single feature about what it is that you're selling that you can
14:22
possibly think of. Like just go nuts. Like just let it all pour out of you.
14:27
And then once you finish this step and your detail sheet is as comprehensive as
14:31
you can make it, we are now ready to part two which is basically to write the
14:35
benefit list. Right? So then what you do is essentially is you go over the detail
14:41
sheet and you translate each feature into a corresponding benefit wherever
14:46
possible. So first let's get clear on the difference of a feature and a
14:51
benefit. you're not 100% clear on this. A feature is simply a detail or a
14:55
specification of what it is that you're selling. Like the fact that like a
14:59
mattress is made from latex or that it comes with a cotton sleeve. Okay. And a
15:05
benefit of what your product will do for the for the buyer basically, right? It's
15:09
like how does that translate into the actual benefit that they will receive
15:13
from that feature? So let's say that your mattress bed is made from like a
15:16
high-grade natural certified latex. Most people, they just focus on that. Like
15:21
people really care. They really care that it's made from a high-grade natural
15:25
certified latex. Like they don't they don't care about that, right? That's a
15:29
feature. The fact of that would translate to benefits including that it
15:35
molds to your body for the perfect comfort and it absorbs the movements of
15:40
a fidgety partner and it makes for a more undisturbed sleep. So you can be
15:46
well-rested and, you know, have a lot of energy and have vitality in your life
15:50
and zest, right? They're the benefits. But there could even be more benefit,
15:56
right? Thanks to like the high-grade natural certified latex, so you will
16:00
sleep more soundly, awake and refresh, perform better during the day at work,
16:05
get that promotion that you wanted, make more money, and move into a bigger house
16:09
in a nicer neighborhood. Right? We're stretching it a little bit there, but
16:13
you can see you can start to say, "Okay, I get it." Like it's it's about what is
16:17
the benefit that it's going to deliver to to the end user. And like all of that
16:22
stuff like we can run through some examples now like staying on on the
16:27
mattress side of things that show you how like these facts and features
16:31
translate into benefits. So the feature as I said high-grade
16:36
certified latex reduces shoulder and hip pressure, good ventilation, allows for
16:42
better blood circulation, provides pressure relief. And these are simple
16:48
things, but like think about what is so much more compelling to the end user,
16:53
right? high-grade natural certified latex or for someone that's got like an
16:58
ailment and a really bad hip pressure and pain just to reduce that, right? Or
17:03
100% organic bamboo cotton sheets. And you know the fe the benefits associated
17:09
with that is it's durable and longlasting. It will save you money.
17:13
You're not going to need to replace it, you know, every 12 months. Made from
17:17
breathable materials, so it keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the
17:21
winter. Okay. So, this is the way that you want to think about it for the
17:25
service that you're selling and really break it down and think about and labor
17:30
over it. Don't just try to like just rush through this and get it done.
17:32
That's not If you spend time laboring over this stuff like you did with the
17:36
research, then all the offers and everything that we're going to be going
17:39
through later in this program about funnels and Facebook ads and all these
17:43
super advanced ninja tactics I'm going to be teaching you, you're going to just
17:47
have the raw materials that you just put in there. But you're not going to have
17:50
it if you don't do the work now. And then you're going to get to that and
17:54
you're going to be like, "Oh, what do I do?" And then you're going to have to
17:55
revisit it. So just listen to what I'm saying. Go ahead and do this. You're
17:59
going to see what a profound impact that it's going to have.
18:03
Um, and then for another one, you know, you for instance might be a mortgage
18:06
broker. Pay off your mortgage in 5 years. And that's kind of like the
18:10
feature of what our service allows them to do. But the benefits of that is you
18:14
live debtree, stress free. You worry less about money and relax. You enjoy
18:18
your time with your family and you live your life free from money worries. You
18:24
can sleep sound at night. You could say, do you know what I mean? Like you don't
18:27
need to be thinking about. So then say for instance, you have something like
18:31
live your life free from money worries. And then you might be writing copy and
18:35
you could be like, you know, you could not have to worry about money when
18:38
you're at your son's soccer game on a Saturday morning and you can be fully
18:43
present with your children on the weekend. And can you imagine what a
18:47
weight off your chest that would be? Do you see how you can start to use this
18:51
stuff and intertwine it into your sales copy to make it very emotive? Right? Or
18:57
you might be like in the legal profession and you might have like a
19:01
willwriting service where you write people's wills for them and the feature
19:04
or the the kind of just blanket offer might be get a will in 14 days for $500.
19:09
Right? That's like that's very clear what you're going to get. But what are
19:13
the benefits from that? Sleep sound at night knowing your affairs are in order.
19:17
Protect everything that you've worked hard for. Avoid emotional and legal
19:22
hardship. Right? So, if you do this and you process it properly and you really
19:27
go through it and like process all of those features into benefits, um you
19:31
should have like several pages of features and corresponding benefits and
19:35
really really know exactly what it is that your market wants. And it really
19:40
comes down to like just making, you know, an offer with balls like this
19:45
squirrel that you can see with huge balls. What we see all the time is that
19:49
most businesses don't do that and that they start in a position of like
19:53
weakness and their promises and their offers are really weak. Um, and it's
19:57
just all super super vague and it doesn't really help us, right? Like it's
20:02
just like download this free report and we'll show you how great it is to have a
20:06
financial planner. use our services. We're really, really great. We've been
20:10
in business for 17 years. No one gives a [ __ ] about any of that stuff. I can tell
20:15
you now. And if you want to really get
20:19
breakthrough results, you have to put in a breakthrough effort, right? You've got
20:25
to work. You've got to do the things that others aren't prepared to do or
20:29
they're just not willing to do if you want to get the results that other
20:33
people think are impossible, right? You want to get people looking at you
20:38
thinking, "How the hell has this person come in here in just a matter of a
20:44
couple of years or in 12 months and just taken over this market? How have they
20:49
done that?" Right? And the reason why you do get those breakthrough results is
20:54
because you've put a breakthrough effort in and you've done the things that all
20:57
the people that aren't getting those results aren't prepared or willing to
21:01
do. So there is no silver silver bullets. is only lead bullets, right?
21:06
I'm going to show you the path that you need to walk down, but when I stop and I
21:10
say like, you need to do this, you need to spend a lot of time on this, spend a
21:13
week on this, do it, right? Because that's the way that you just get
21:18
absolute offers that just strike like lightning and just tear everyone in that
21:24
market to pieces. And it's because you did the work. There isn't just because
21:27
you got lucky. You did the work and you got the result, right? And you know when
21:33
when you look at those things about like download a free report or do business
21:37
with us we've been in 17 years right those are all offers that don't appeal
21:41
to people right as they're just not enticing. They're boring and you can't
21:47
bore people into buying. So here is how to go about it the right way. Firstly
21:51
forget about your lawyer. Forget about your industry regulations that you
21:56
operate in for now. Right? Just for now. and think about what would be the
22:02
promise or the offer that you would make if you had a magic wand and there were
22:07
absolutely no rules, no regulations, and no limits to what it is that you could
22:13
do. Like make this thing outrageous, like really go crazy on it. um when you
22:19
start and you know you think about what would be the very best end result that
22:23
you could promise in the absolute shortest amount of time possible even if
22:29
it's not your whole service but you're just splintering off some of your
22:33
service um that would give your prospects some very quick results like
22:37
that instant hit that they want right and get creative with it I want you to
22:42
come up with the most powerful and outrageous offer that you can and And
22:48
then I want you to reduce it down to writing, right? And it should be no more
22:51
than a few lines. I'm not talking about like a page. This is not a sales letter,
22:54
right? This is an offer. So no one is going to see this piece of paper or this
22:58
document in the beginning, right? It's just you. So don't worry about how crazy
23:02
and outlandish this thing is, right? And this gives you an opportunity just to go
23:07
over the top and to go too far with your offer. That's what you want to do. We
23:12
want to push it too far where it's just too outrageous rather than the opposite
23:16
of what everybody does and they have a weak and watered down offer and then it
23:22
doesn't start to work. They start to kind of just add stuff to it and that's
23:26
just like it's a horrible horrible way, right? So then you want to put it down
23:30
on paper and start by putting it back to something that you can actually back up
23:35
and deliver on. So you start with it really really crazy and then we start to
23:40
kind of go okay I couldn't say that like that's going to get me sued back into
23:44
the stone age so I need to remove that from the offer or I can't deliver on
23:48
that let me pull that one back right and then you want to make it something that
23:53
you could actually deliver on and that won't get you sued for like false claims
23:58
right now obviously you know you have to offer only what you can deliver on
24:03
otherwise that promise is going to backfire and cause you all types of
24:07
headaches and problems for you further down the line. So, you do not want to do
24:11
that. But you do really want to start really, really big, put it down on
24:16
paper, and then dial it back to something that is still extremely
24:21
irresistible and that you're still confident that you can deliver on,
24:26
right? And irresistible offers are detailed and they are specific. So, let
24:32
me explain what I mean by that. So, let's just say that we're selling
24:35
mattresses online. And let's look at like a lackluster offer that I found
24:39
just by doing a quick Google search. And generally, when you're online and you're
24:44
searching for things, it's very, very rare to have people that have great
24:49
offers, right? Which is why it's no surprise that so many businesses fail,
24:54
right? They just think that they're failing. They wonder why, right? And the
24:57
biggest reason that they fail is because they cannot ring the cash register, you
25:04
know, in high enough volumes with fat enough margins to sustain their
25:08
business. I.e., they can't advertise and make the numbers make sense where
25:14
they're making money over and above what it costs them to advertise and acquire a
25:20
customer. And the reason, the fundamental reason that is is because
25:24
their offers are weak and not enough people when they advertise to a 100 or a
25:29
thousand or 100,000 people are taking them up on that offer where they're
25:34
making enough money to make that mathematical equation stack up. Right?
25:39
So, I went on a little bit of a tangent there, but this is what you can see up
25:42
on screen. So, buy your mattress online. Fast and free delivery. Oz made with
25:48
free delivery. Buy your mattress online today for better quality. Factory
25:51
direct, locallyowned and operated, various payment options, types,
25:56
headboards, assembled bases, bed frames, and mattresses. Right? So, basically,
26:02
this thing I it's crap, right? Essentially, if you boil it down, it's
26:06
buy an Australianmade mattress online with free and fast delivery, right? And
26:10
it's just incredibly ordinary vanilla offer. However, like at least like to
26:16
give them some credit that they have some resemblance of an offer, right?
26:19
There is free delivery in there and yada yada yada. But let's compare this vague
26:25
watered down offer to a winning offer. All right, so take Casper Mattress,
26:31
right? They're they're a mattress in a box startup and this is their offer. Get
26:35
America's best reviewed mattress delivered to your door for free with a
26:40
100 night trial. This is an irresistible offer that has helped Casper shake up a
26:48
stale $29 billion mattress industry and take them from 0 as a very small
26:55
startup, you know, to over $600 million in sales in their first four years of
27:01
business. That's the power of an irresistible offer, right? There's
27:06
specificity in it. There's risk reversal. and you're going out into a
27:11
marketplace with a really really strong and compelling Godfather offer. And if
27:16
you're in a market for like a highquality mattress, then this offer is
27:22
something that would get your attention. It would get you to sit up in your
27:25
chair. It will, you know, raise the hairs on the back of your neck for a
27:29
moment and it will demand your attention, right? because it's a killer
27:33
offer and it just cuts through all the noise and all the static in a
27:37
marketplace and just cuts right to through to the center of what it is that
27:41
people want, right? They want a really popular and really good mattress
27:46
delivered to their door for free and then you want to review reverse all the
27:50
risk for the end user and say if it isn't the best thing the best mattress
27:54
you've ever had, just return it in 100 nights for free. That is an irresistible
27:59
offer. So, how did this work for them? Well, like, you know, just aside from
28:04
the $600 million, you know, in revenue, you know, did people pay attention?
28:09
Well, they certainly did. Their mattresses have over 45,000
28:13
reviews at the time of putting together this video. Um, with almost 30,000 of
28:18
them being five stars, right, that they're crushing it. Here is another
28:22
example. Let's say we're a home building company. And again, I've done a quick
28:26
Google search to see what kind of offers people are running out there in the
28:30
marketplace. You know, what kind of home builders, what what they're offering.
28:33
Here's one. Homebuilders Melbourne. Explore our latest designs. Designing
28:39
luxury homes from a range of elegant designs. Inquire now. Visitor display
28:44
center. House and land packages. Find your dream home. 2016 multi-awward
28:49
winner. type singlestory, double story, ready built, display homes, home
28:54
designs, knockdown, rebuild, display homes where we build, right? So
29:00
essentially they're basically saying designing luxury homes for a range of
29:04
elegant designs. Again, this is just so so vague and very vanilla and it's just
29:10
going to be completely ignored in a sea of other lame and impotent offers that
29:15
provoke zero action. Right? So, let's look at something that would be a killer
29:20
offer in the space. We build your new home in just 30 weeks or give you $5,000
29:25
in cash, right? And that's an offer that that we came up with for a client and we
29:32
found that like the big pain point of their of building a home with like a
29:36
boutique builder and a boutique luxury builder was that like builders keep on
29:41
dragging out the projects and missing deadlines. And when we did the Halo
29:45
strategy, we found that that was just like a huge reoccurring theme is that
29:49
like, you know, they wanted to get something that was boutique and wasn't
29:52
like a mass market builder, but there was a lot of fear around like their
29:57
house taking way more time than it should do. And when they'd already like
30:02
gotten lended the money from the bank and then they were starting to make
30:06
repayments and it drags out, it just becomes this horrendous experience. So,
30:10
we thought about like how do we address that then? And so we created this offer
30:16
and had it in front and center of all the marketing that we were doing for the
30:20
client. And how did it go? Well, let me tell you how it went, right? This offer
30:24
took this client from $0, like never receiving a deposit on a new home build
30:30
to over $7 million in revenue in their first eight months, right? And that's
30:35
just like the power of having a really good offer. It's just like you are able
30:40
to convert people a lot more easier and just make all your marketing way more
30:45
profitable. Now, let's look at another one. Let's
30:50
look at something a little bit closer to home. Okay, so I did a quick search for
30:55
SEO agencies and saw this company who I won't name and shame and or do all of
30:59
that kind of stuff, but this is their offer, right? Best SEO management
31:03
digital marketing experts, 100% results focused. No locking contract. Best local
31:10
SEO management company. Manage SEO services. Leading SEO agency,
31:15
award-winning agency, expert SEO advice. That is just riveting. It absolutely
31:21
gets me stood up in my chair or ppped up ready to go. I am joking. Right.
31:26
Basically, what they're saying is best SEO management and digital
31:31
marketing experts. Right? Once again, this company is suffering from a generic
31:36
offer and like, you know, it's just there isn't any of an offer in there. I
31:41
can't even call it an offer, right? It's more of just a statement with no
31:45
specificity, no risk reversal or time frames or nothing, right? This is going
31:51
to be hard to awaken your prospects from their sleepy state and shoot that
31:55
electric shock through their body and provoke them to actually take action,
32:00
right? let alone just to click on on on your ad to begin with. Right now, let's
32:04
take a look at what a winning offer in this space looks like.
32:09
Guaranteed Google rankings in 90 days or we work for for free.
32:15
Now, that is an offer. It's bold. It's specific. It has risk reversal in it.
32:21
And you know, obviously, if we couldn't deliver on that, then we would be going
32:26
out of business pretty quickly, right? This is the offer that you know I
32:30
formulated in our business and this offer has helped us invade and conquer
32:36
an industry that is hyper competitive. The waters are bloody from fierce
32:42
competition in our space and has taken King Kong from just me in my bedroom,
32:49
right, to growing the number one fastest digital agency in Australia multiple
32:55
years in a row and being awarded the 28th fastest growing company in
33:00
Australia across all industries, right? By the Australian Financial Review. And
33:06
we did this with no venture capital, you know, no partners, no rich uncles or any
33:14
of that kind of stuff. And that's the power of a potent offer. That's the
33:17
that's the the potency that this offer can have when you go out into a
33:21
marketplace and just really just crush the competition.
33:27
And your offer must be something that is new, unique, exciting, easy,
33:34
predictable, and huge, right? It must be something that nobody has ever seen or
33:40
heard before. Instead, most people sell things that are old, dull, and boring,
33:45
and something that everybody has seen many times before. And you know, since
33:50
we launched that offer, we've obviously had so many copycats come and copy that
33:54
and blah blah blah blah blah. But your offer must must be new, unique,
33:59
exciting, easy, predictable, and huge. All right? Otherwise, it's just not
34:03
going to it's not going to fly. Now, the reason why that is is because
34:09
it is the offer that you are making that is the tip of the spear of your
34:14
marketing message. You see, a strong offer will succeed in spite of weak
34:19
copy, but strong copy will not overcome a weak offer. So, we can write like
34:27
really strong emotional copy with a killer headline and intriguing bullets
34:33
and craft a really great guarantee. However, if you won't be flexible in
34:39
creating an irresistible offer for your market, then none of that stuff even
34:42
matters, right? Because all of that stuff is not going to trump having a
34:47
killer godfather irresistible offer. It's just not going to happen. And a
34:53
strong offer is not solely based on price. Like usually when I talk about
34:57
this concept to business owners, they're like, "Well, we're a really expensive
35:01
service, right? Like having an offer based just on the lowest price can
35:07
easily be copied." So that's not what we're talking about, right? Because it's
35:11
just really easy for a competitor to go out there and copy just a price, right?
35:15
And whoever wins that race to the bottom, like they're the ones that
35:20
usually lose in any case. So, it's actually usually the opposite. Like most
35:24
of our clients, you know, are the most expensive options in their market as
35:29
having a potent offer will allow you to command higher fees because you can go
35:34
out there and convert so many more people, right? And you have to convert
35:38
fewer people in order to make the numbers stack up. And having the
35:42
following is not an irresistible offer, right? Having great service is not an
35:47
irresistible offer or outstanding quality or being innovative or even
35:52
having a great team or being responsive to your customers needs or having a
35:56
great reputation. That is not an offer, right?
36:01
That is features to what it is that your business provides. And I have a saying
36:06
and that is if the offer and guarantee do not keep the founder up at night,
36:11
then they are not strong enough. Right? When I came up with that guarantee for
36:15
King Kong and I was selling out of my bedroom, that thing would keep me up at
36:19
night. What happens if I have to return these people's money? What happens if
36:22
I'm not making any money and then all of a sudden like how am I going to survive?
36:27
Right? So, it must be strong. It must make you feel a little bit queasy.
36:32
That's how you know that you're on to something that is really, really good,
36:35
right? Because one thing that I can tell you from spending spending tens and tens
36:40
of millions of dollars is that the best laser targeted traffic cannot save a
36:45
typical ordinary good enough offer, right? It's just not going to work. It's
36:51
just it's not going to cut it. Like it doesn't matter how ninja your your media
36:57
buyer is or how good your Facebook ads are. They're all centered and they all
37:03
congregate around the offer and it needs to be killer, right? And the a good
37:08
thing to remember is and to really take note of is that a compelling offer is
37:12
infinitely more powerful than a convincing argument.
37:18
Because if you're on the phone with somebody and you're trying to convince
37:21
them of the value of what it is that you do or why you are so good or how this
37:27
service that you're providing to them can really help them, you you're
37:31
basically forming a convincing argument of why they should part with their
37:35
hard-earned money, right? And you're like dragging them kind of kicking and
37:39
screaming to take you up on your offer. where the opposite of that is you have a
37:44
compelling offer that is magnetic and it sucks people towards it cuz they want
37:50
it. Right? And the idea of a compelling offer is really to remove all the
37:55
friction for a prospect to buy from you. Right? You want to reverse the risk and
38:00
burden that as a business. So you want to take all the risk that's present in
38:04
that transaction and make it an absolute no-brainer for them to take you up on
38:09
your offer. This is really what we're talking about here, right? Making it as
38:16
seamless, as easy for people to buy off you and to make it as much of as a
38:21
nobrainer because the offer is so compelling.
38:25
And here's a quote from Claude Hopkins to even cement that is you want to make
38:29
your offer so great that only a lunatic would refuse to buy. Right? And you
38:35
know, that's a quote that I love and it's really what you want to think about
38:38
when you're looking at your offer. like, is this such a good offer that you would
38:43
have to literally be completely mad not to take me up on this offer? And if the
38:49
answer is yes, then you've got a, you know, you're a godfather offer because
38:52
the offer is paramount. And I'm not hopefully you get it by now. I'm not
38:56
going to stress it enough, but it is this is something that it's like I
38:59
typically have to like pound people's head against the wall till they get this
39:03
stuff because they don't understand the importance of it and they think that
39:07
everything else will overcome the fact that their offer isn't really really
39:13
killer, right? So, the offer is paramount. So, we know that it's
39:16
paramount. Now, let me break you down through the seven-part Godfather offer
39:21
framework. And this is where we really look at the seven constituent parts that
39:26
your offer must include in order for it to be a Godfather offer. And the first
39:32
one that you need is rationale. Right? So compelling offers begin with a clear
39:40
and credible explanation of why you're making such an outrageously generous
39:46
offer. So perhaps for you it might be like a special introductory offer and
39:51
you're so confident that once the prospect experienced the truly amazing
39:55
benefits of your product or your service, then they'll be a raving fan of
39:59
your company and they'll be a customer for life. That's why you're offering it
40:03
at such a crazy price. Or maybe you have a more efficient business model than
40:08
your competitors. And this allows you to pass the savings on to your customer,
40:13
exposing like a hoax or a con or positioning them um positioning yourself
40:18
as like a concerned advoc advocate for that market and really casting stones at
40:23
a shared enemy and becoming your new customer, their greatest champion for
40:27
your customer, right? And it might be you're going up against the banks or
40:30
you're showing like you have a more efficient model for manufacturing
40:34
something or delivering a service where you can cut the middleman out and strip
40:38
away all the bloat and pass those savings on to the end user. That's
40:42
rationale. You're providing rationale to the outrageous offer that you're making
40:47
this person and you're providing proof that there is a reason. there is a
40:52
rationale behind the reasoning for this amazing and truly spectacular and almost
40:59
unbelievable offer that you're making to them. Right? And then once you've got
41:05
that, you want to put it up in lights and make it abundantly clear to ensure
41:11
that your offer is believable, right? You can't just be like, you know, this
41:15
used to be 50 grand and now it's 10 grand. Like, okay, well, why did it used
41:19
to be 50 grand? Who have you sold it to? What are the parts that add to it to
41:23
make up to it being $50,000? So, there needs to be some believability to it.
41:29
And the way that you do that is by having some rationale.
41:32
Now, the next part is building value. So, you want to build the value off your
41:39
offer based on the usual everyday price that it can be like what you would
41:46
normally charge for this or even what your competitors are charging for this,
41:51
right? And it's important to establish that your regular price and really like
41:56
kind of concrete it in there and make that seem like really good value, like
41:59
just the everyday price, like what your competitors are doing. You want to build
42:03
the value to that price point to make your regular price really believable
42:08
that you got the specifics in there and you got all the detail. And they're all
42:11
really crucial elements so you can prove that, right? And then you want to tell
42:16
your prospects where your product has been offered or
42:20
sold or your service at that full price or even how many thousands of people
42:26
have paid that full price for your service before. And the key with this
42:31
one is to show don't tell. So wherever it's possible, it's very important to
42:36
include screenshots of other websites and cataloges and just undeniable proof
42:44
because it makes like it even more believable to that everyday skeptic cuz
42:49
everybody is skeptical, right? And we really need to prove to them that this
42:53
is indeed true. We're not just saying that that is that that's the price,
42:56
right? and you're not building like this superficial value or hype which is what
43:01
everybody does. So we want to be different to what everybody does is and
43:04
we want to literally show them screenshots and all that kind of graphs
43:07
and anything that we can that supports our argument. We want to show we don't
43:12
want to tell cuz it's easy to tell and you know when you show it shows real
43:17
depth and proof to the claims that you're making.
43:20
Then once you know you've basically like illustrated in great detail why even at
43:27
the full price that your product or service is an incredible deal. Then you
43:32
show how your product or service is just a mere pittance to what they will make
43:38
or save even at the regular price. And then after you do that, then you reveal
43:42
your discount in a way that really is dramatic and it illustrates your role as
43:48
your prospect's advocate and their champion and just really just tell them
43:53
what an incredible deal that they're getting. And you want to quantify the
43:58
monetary benefits that that product or service will deliver and compare it to
44:04
the almost insignificant price that you're asking for in return in order for
44:09
them to get that benefit. And then what you want to do is reduce it down to the
44:14
ridiculous. breaking the price down into like a daily or a weekly figure. Or
44:20
compare it to something like that's really trivial like that they spend more
44:24
on, you know, their parking than they do on this service or a cup of coffee or a
44:29
protein shake or you know that it's just $1.33
44:34
per day or per week or per month or you know it's cheaper than a cup of coffee
44:38
per day and you get these huge amazing monstrous benefits. Okay? Because people
44:45
buy things that make them feel better about themselves, right? And that's, you
44:50
know, in in the words of David Oglevy, one of the advertising greats, and
44:54
that's something that you really need to be thinking about is that like they they
44:59
go out and they buy things that just make them feel better about themselves.
45:04
Now, the next point and the third pillar is really pricing. Now, when it comes to
45:10
pricing, I found that it's best to have three options that you can present to
45:15
your prospects, right? Being an entry-level price without the bells and
45:19
whistles. And this should be like the price that you're actually happy with,
45:23
that you actually want to get, right? And that's just a very bare bones entry
45:28
level. And then you want to have a mid-pric point. And this is the one that
45:33
you present as the best fit and gives you a nice bump in profitability, right?
45:37
just gives you that little little bit of a bump. And then three is like the
45:41
deluxe version. And this has all the bells and whistles and and the delivery
45:45
of the benefits to your prospects, you know, in the quickest time possible for
45:50
those people that have an urgent pro urgent problem and they they need quick
45:54
results. They need it really, really quick. That's the deluxe version. Right
45:58
now, at this p point, you might be thinking like, where does my godfather
46:02
offer fit into all of this? Right? Is it all on a landing page or what what's
46:07
happening on? Right? And I'll explain like the exact sequencing and everything
46:12
later in the program, but for now just know this, right? If you're selling high
46:17
ticket services like i.e. anything more than like two or three grand per month,
46:22
this generally requires you to get on the phone and convert a prospect into a
46:28
paying client. Like you're not going to be it's not going to be an e-commerce
46:31
transaction, right? This is done over the telephone. So, the game is all about
46:35
generating as many highquality leads as possible. Therefore, your first
46:39
Godfather offer will be a free consultation because that's what we want
46:44
people to do. That's the first offer that we're making to them, right? Is
46:48
that consultation, but you still do need to attach like a
46:52
dollar amount to that consultation. And you still need to sell hard to get
46:57
people to take you up on your offer even though it's free, right? You can't just
47:01
slap free on it and just think like you you just your calendar is going to be
47:04
bursting at the seams with people wanting to speak to you. Your offer
47:08
should be specific. So you can't just slap that free consultation and then
47:13
just think that everyone's coming. No, no, no, no, no. You should it needs to
47:16
be like it's a 30, 45, 60 minute phone consultation.
47:21
you're going to get an analysis or a strategy session or a roadmap and really
47:25
break down and build value around, you know, that phone call in it in itself,
47:33
right? Regardless of what you're actual going to try to sell them, that
47:37
consultation should be of value in itself. And it should take that prospect
47:42
from where they are and leave them in a better position whether or not they
47:45
choose to buy from you. Now, I'll be giving you the exact examples of how to
47:50
structure this um for for lead generation
47:54
um later in in the program when we dive into building out your funnels and all
47:59
of that kind of stuff. I'll be showing you exactly, right? Uh but for now,
48:03
we're specifically talking about the offer that you're making to your market
48:08
when you're actually trying to convert them into paying clients. So, I'm going
48:13
to show you exactly the Godfather offer to generate the leads, but for now,
48:17
we're talking about the actual service that you're going to be selling or the
48:21
product that you're going to be um selling. Cool. So, let's keep moving.
48:25
The fourth point is payment options. Now when your ideal price point, the level
48:32
at like which it is that your most of your customers will buy is relatively
48:36
high for your prospects, consider breaking that up that purchase up into a
48:42
payment plan of like, you know, two, three or four payments, right? So by
48:47
doing this, you effectively lower the perceived price point in your prospect's
48:53
mind. And this should also increase your response and your conversion rate. Plus,
48:58
today money is always more crucial to a prospect's decision to buy than
49:05
tomorrow's money. So, what I mean by that is like, say for instance, it's a
49:10
$6,000 service that you're selling. Breaking that down into $2,000 this
49:14
month, 2,000 next month, and then 2,000 the month after that. like that today
49:20
money of in their mind, okay, I need to part with $2,000 is way more crucial to
49:26
them than even that it's going to have to be $6,000, right, in in total value
49:31
and $4,000 in tomorrow's money, so to speak. Okay, so payment options are a
49:37
great way to do that. The next point, point five, is premiums. So, these are
49:43
the the free gifts that prospects receive along with the product or
49:48
service that you that they're purchasing off you right now. Premiums are not to
49:52
be scoffed at. You might be rolling your eyes and thinking about like late night
49:56
infomercials that they're like, "But wait, there's more. You'll also get this
50:00
free set of steak knives if you order right now." But the reason that premiums
50:04
are used is because they work, right? Having a hot premium can double or
50:10
triple your sales. When you start paying attention to like the commercials on
50:15
television that are in the media that or that are online or like that are really
50:19
pushing it hard, you'll realize the ones that really work like the ones that are
50:24
advertising with some real force and that are spending hundreds of millions
50:29
of dollars, they mostly all have premiums attached to them. So why do you
50:34
think, right? Do you think that they just enjoy burning money and eroding
50:37
their margins by having a premium? No. It's because it dramatically increases
50:43
the response to your core offer, right? And a great example of that is of having
50:50
like a really hot premium is from Sports Illustrated. So in the summer of 1986,
50:56
Martin Champagne um he was the magazine's marketing manager, right? And
51:01
he found himself like in the difficult situation where over the last few
51:06
promotions that he had launched, they all bombed. Meaning that they weren't
51:10
persuading enough people in order to actually part with their money and
51:14
subscribe to the magazine, which basically, you know, is the worst news
51:19
that you can ever get as a marketing manager for a magazine, right? So he
51:24
needed to do something new, something fresh, something that no one had ever
51:28
seen or heard of before. um and really come up with an offer that people
51:33
couldn't resist cuz everyone was resisting their their current offer. And
51:37
it was then that he found like the football phone premium and that was when
51:42
it was born. And Sports Illustrated ran television ads giving away a football
51:48
phone as a premium with a yearly subscription of the magazine.
51:52
Okay. And this premium went to sell 1.6 6 million subscription for this once
52:00
hurting publication, right? You know, and here here's the quote,
52:05
right? Um, as well as a sneaker phone that followed its football-shaped
52:09
predecessor, the magazine sold around 1.6 million new subscribers between 1986
52:16
and 1991, thanks in large to that part of the football phone, right? Like that
52:21
is really the importance of it. But you know really what what I want to tell you
52:26
about is that like of course I had to then market that thing, right? So they
52:31
were running like aggressive television ads giving away the the football phone
52:35
as like a premium. But I want to give you some examples now of, you know, how
52:41
you could apply this to your service-based business because like
52:44
premiums are a proven way to pull in more sales. But I'm not saying that like
52:48
if you're a home builder that you want to go out there and start offering your
52:51
clients a football phone, right? The premium has to be aligned and relevant
52:56
to the core business and the core offer that you're making. For Sports
53:00
Illustrated, like that's a football phone, so it's going to get people that
53:03
are passionate about football and their magazine subscription is a magazine
53:08
about sports. So, it aligns. So, here are some examples of premiums that you
53:12
could use in a service-based business. So, the first one here is is you're a
53:17
home building company. If someone's getting a new home, you could offer them
53:20
a free 80 80in LED TV, right? Or a $5,000 furniture and appliance voucher.
53:27
It's You might be thinking, well, look, that's a trivial thing, Sabry. You know,
53:31
in the scheme of someone buying a 300, $4,000, $500,000, or a million dollar
53:36
home. You'd be surprised, right? And it's kind of like the the thing that
53:42
they need is a new home, but the thing that they want is that big 80in LE TV to
53:47
put into their lounge room and watch, you know, a football game when they get
53:50
in there. So that's, you know, a premium that's aligned with, you know, that core
53:56
offer that they're making. Or it might be like a romantic getaway if you're
54:02
like a divorce lawyer or you're a counselor trying to counsel somebody
54:06
through a divorce. um and a and help them not get it. You know, having like a
54:11
travel voucher, right? If if you wanted to go down that angle or you could have
54:16
a free $2,000 travel voucher as a premium for completely different reasons
54:20
if they were getting a divorce. Right. At King Kong, in in my business, we
54:26
offer a free $3,500 Crow audit for anyone who signs up as a
54:31
King Kong client where they're just signing up for traffic. will give them a
54:35
full breakdown audit of their website and recommendations and everything that
54:39
they need to change that we value at $3,500 that you get for free. That's the
54:44
premium. That's a thing that they might want, right, attached to it. Well, they
54:48
do want cuz it works very, very well for us. Um, so that's kind of some examples
54:52
that you can see of like a premium for, you know, what it is that you're
54:56
offering as a service-based business. Now the sixth pillar of a Godfather
55:01
offer is a power guarantee. Right? So the stronger your guarantee the better.
55:08
The role of the guarantee is to reverse the risk for the prospect and place it
55:13
on you the business owner. Right? Thus removing that friction before making the
55:18
sale. So 30-day or 12 month guarantees tend to be the most common, right?
55:23
However, it's much better to deliver a specific, right? To be very, very
55:30
specific. And if the guarantee is attached to the performance of what it
55:34
is that you're selling, you can follow the program and if you don't lose 10
55:37
kilos in your first 180 days, just let us know and we'll refund every scent.
55:44
Cuz most people just have like a 30-day or a 12 um 12 month back guarantee,
55:49
right? But they don't get specific. And if you if you get specific and you tie
55:54
it to the end benefit, I found that that works a lot better. And it allows you to
55:59
also make it a conditional guarantee where there are conditions of them
56:03
actually needing to do the work. Right? It's not someone is signing up and just
56:06
going, "No, I'm not happy. Give me my money back." That's not how it works,
56:09
right? But however, this is an example we say if you follow the program,
56:16
right? They have to follow the program, do the exercises, eat all the food, and
56:20
you don't lose 10 kilos in the first 180 days. Just let us know and we'll refund
56:25
every cent that you've paid. Right? So, we're going to be diving though into the
56:30
exact specifics of guarantees in in in just a minute. Um, but lastly, the last
56:35
thing to look at is the seventh and last part of the Godfather offer, which is
56:41
scarcity. And this thing is really, really important. So offers without
56:46
scarcity, they don't sell as well because you know it just you have like a
56:52
ticking time bomb on your head. You really feel motivated to take action,
56:55
but it needs to be genuine, right? Otherwise, you're going to erode brand
57:00
trust with your prospects. Think about it, right? If you don't need to take
57:04
action on an offer that's being made, when will you take it? And the answer is
57:10
later. and later equals never, right? So delay
57:16
is the death of a sale. So scarcity is really important. And examples of
57:22
scarcity include like putting an expiration date on your offer, countdown
57:26
clocks or we only have, you know, seven left at this price or buy before X to
57:31
avoid the price hike. We only have so many hours in a day or employees to
57:36
service you. So, you know, the products are left in the warehouse, whatever it
57:40
might be. So you can have like there's only so many hours in a day, we only
57:43
have so many employees to service you or there's only so many products left in
57:47
our warehouse at this insanely crazy price that we're offering you. Right? So
57:52
scarcity has been shown time and time again to dramatically increase the
57:57
pulling power of offers. You know, I've split tested this thing to the high
58:01
heavens and you know, the best marketers use them because they work. inject
58:06
scarcity into your offer and that really tells your prospect that you know that
58:12
they need to act and they need to act fast.
58:16
So they're the seven pillars that make up a Godfather offer. Now, once you've
58:21
mapped out your Godfather offer, you now want to set sit aside and just kind of
58:27
ask yourself like, what are the objections that a skeptical prospect
58:32
might have in taking me up on this offer, even though it's absolutely
58:37
crazy, right? And you want to spend some time thinking about the objections that
58:42
your prospects will have. and you want to write them down and you want to jump
58:45
on sales calls and you want to find out what are those big objections, right?
58:50
Because this is where we preframe them and then we just obliterate those
58:55
things, right? And basically what you want to do is you want to think about
58:59
those three main objections that people are going to have to your offer and you
59:02
just write them down. So you just list them out, think about them. Once you've
59:07
done that, then we want to think about how we can overcome these objections,
59:13
right? And that's what we do once we've completed that that exercise of just
59:18
writing all three of them because that moves us to the last step, right? And
59:23
that is to read your offer and ask yourself,
59:28
what can I add to this offer to even make it even more compelling? what can I
59:34
add on and just make it way more irresistible than it currently is. Now,
59:39
once you've made your offer as irresistible as humanly possible,
59:44
then make sure that the copy is tightly written. Like, you know, offer copy that
59:49
surrounds the offer needs to be direct and to the point. There can be no
59:53
confusion about what the prospect will receive in exchange for their money or
59:58
their time when they receive it and why it's going to benefit them. It has to
1:00:03
just be nice, clearcut, short, and concise. That means that you must edit
1:00:08
your copy even more, ruthlessly, like ruthlessly edit this thing down more
1:00:14
than just normal copy. Making sure that everything is just crystal clear and
1:00:18
there's nothing that's vague in there at all. I can't stress the importance of of
1:00:22
really laboring over this offer creation more than I have. I know. I've pumped
1:00:28
this thing up because, you know, once you know what your market wants and you
1:00:33
package it all up in the most irresistible offer, everything becomes a
1:00:38
lot easier. And once you experience a taste of what a Godfather offer like
1:00:42
does to your bottom line. You'll never look at it the same way again and you'll
1:00:47
really really place the importance on it that it deserves. Okay, so let's jump to
1:00:53
you know what a topic that we touched on which is you know creating a market
1:00:58
slaughtering power guarantee. Now a power a power guarantee that slaughters
1:01:03
your competition and leaves them screaming for mercy because they just
1:01:08
don't know how you can have such an outrageous guarantee. Right? And here is
1:01:14
a simple but devastatingly effective sales strategy that you can really
1:01:18
deploy that will dramatically transform your business. And it's about
1:01:23
having one of these guarantees, right? Um, and I'm now going to show you like
1:01:28
how to eradicate all that sales resistance and skepticism that you've
1:01:33
previously been faced with through having a power guarantee. Right? And
1:01:38
this simply kind of approaches, you know, your market and builds trust with
1:01:43
them and goodwill, right? While allowing you to also get as much customers as
1:01:50
possible and that you know what to do with because you reversed all the risk
1:01:53
for them with your guarantee. Now,
1:01:58
guarantees are nothing new. And while about like everybody's heard of a
1:02:03
guarantee, like very very few businesses ever know how to craft one that takes
1:02:10
full advantage of its incredible selling power. Like,
1:02:16
and that's precisely like what I'm going to explain to you now is all about
1:02:21
because you know, everyone like they've heard of guarantee like, "Yeah, yeah,
1:02:25
yeah, no, guarantee. We've got we've got a 30-day money back guarantee, right?"
1:02:28
But that's not that's not what we're going to be talking about here. I'm
1:02:31
going to be taking you by the hand and showing you how to take your ordinary
1:02:36
guarantee that you probably have and just pump this thing up on steroids,
1:02:42
right? You're going to discover how to soo even the most skeptical prospects
1:02:46
and make your guarantee so compelling that it cripples the competition and
1:02:51
really brings them to their knees pleading for mercy, wondering, you know,
1:02:55
how is it that you're doing this? And you know, like just waving the white
1:02:58
flag. But wait a minute.
1:03:02
Am I hearing from you that you're saying that you don't already have a guarantee?
1:03:07
Are you trying to tell me that you thought that we could just have those
1:03:10
seven parts of the the Godfather offer framework and that your prospects, you
1:03:16
know, you just tell them how great you are and that they would just line up and
1:03:19
throw money at you. Well, unfortunately, that is not how this thing works. So
1:03:24
before I I I get to work, let me address some of the biggest concerns around
1:03:29
having a guarantee. Cuz you know, by the end of this, you're going to have a
1:03:32
guarantee, right? And I'm going to really address what your inner most
1:03:37
skeptical and pessimist person on that shoulder might be whispering in your ear
1:03:42
right now like, I don't want to have a guarantee, right? It's inconvenient for
1:03:46
me, right? I don't I don't want to burden some of that risk. Can't I just
1:03:49
sell what I got and and enough people are going to buy? Listen, right?
1:03:55
If you're not willing to guarantee your products and services in some way,
1:03:59
shape, or form, then why should any of your prospects trust you? Stop and think
1:04:05
about that just for a moment, right? If you're not willing to guarantee any
1:04:10
element of the services that you sell, why on
1:04:15
earth should anybody trust you with their hard-earned money?
1:04:22
Like how are you different from all the other companies that they've done
1:04:26
business with, right? That they've tried their solution that they promised would
1:04:30
give them the outcome only to be left with empty promises and disappointment.
1:04:35
Right? You need to realize that your prospect has been let down, misled, and
1:04:40
downright lied to by other businesses, right? They're skeptical, highly
1:04:45
skeptical. And if you're not willing to offer a guarantee for your product or
1:04:49
service, then how can you possibly put those fears to bed that you're not like
1:04:53
everybody else, right? Think about this. If you don't
1:04:58
have a guarantee, you're literally placing all of the risk of your
1:05:03
prospect's purchase on them and no risk on you. What does that say about your
1:05:08
business, right? you're not really like willing to burden any of those things
1:05:15
for them. And if you're really planning on growing and scaling your business, it
1:05:19
means that like the majority of the advertising that you're going to be
1:05:23
doing is to that cold traffic, that blue ocean that we spoke about. That is
1:05:28
people who do not know, like, or trust you. And these people, you know, they're
1:05:33
people that are just online and like they've either been doing research or
1:05:38
they haven't been doing research or they've seen one of your Facebook or
1:05:41
Instagram ads or whatever it might be, right?
1:05:44
And essentially, you're asking a complete stranger to part with their
1:05:50
hardearned money for a product or service that they don't even know is
1:05:54
going to solve their problem. Right? Because they've already been told this
1:05:59
before. you're not the first person to tell them that you can help them. So, a
1:06:04
powerful guarantee reverses that risk and it reduces the friction for someone
1:06:08
to buy and you want to lead with a Godfather strategy, right? With a
1:06:13
Godfather offer, which is to make them an offer that they can't refuse. And
1:06:19
then, and after you've done that, that's not enough in itself.
1:06:23
Then you want to back that up, right, with a you can't lose guarantee
1:06:28
and reverse all the risk. And that just makes that offer infinitely more
1:06:34
compelling and just sucks people into them like flies to a light, right? If if
1:06:39
you're confident with what you're selling, then why wouldn't you make it
1:06:43
as easy as possible for as many people to buy your product or services,
1:06:49
right? Cuz to do otherwise just doesn't make any sense. Like if you're really
1:06:53
confident, you know that it's going to help a lot of people, then why don't you
1:06:56
make it as irresistible as possible by having a strong guarantee and reversing
1:07:00
that risk to get as many people on board to experience those benefits as
1:07:05
possible. Right? And if you're still not like
1:07:08
quite on the same page and you think that I've lost my marbles, like let me
1:07:12
just ask you this question. What would you do if a customer bought from you,
1:07:17
right? and then for one reason or another they weren't satisfied with what
1:07:22
they bought off you. How would you make that right for them, right? Would you
1:07:25
just say, "Oh, look, bad luck, dude." Like, that's what it is. Or would you
1:07:29
say, "Look, you've bought it and like, you know, I
1:07:34
want to help you get the solution to what you want, right? Um, would you work
1:07:39
with them to ensure that they are happy or would you say like, no, it's it's
1:07:43
your problem?" Probably not, right? You'd probably work with them to ensure
1:07:46
that they're happy and even probably help them like with some of the
1:07:52
mechanics of it to even add more equity to your brand by really helping them get
1:07:57
to the solution that they want. Right? And the answer to that question should
1:08:00
be obvious, right? However, if it's not, let me make something brutally clear and
1:08:07
let me bring something to your attention that you might not be aware of. By law
1:08:12
in most countries, if someone buys from your business and something is defective
1:08:17
or it doesn't perform as advertised or could be perceived as not being
1:08:23
truthfully advertised, the consumer is entitled to compensation with either a
1:08:30
repair or replace goods or a part of them resupply or fixing a problem with a
1:08:37
service, you know, or and in Australia that's enforced. by the Australian
1:08:42
competition um and consumer commission the AC. So right and in every country
1:08:50
you typically have your version of this. So what that means is that you already
1:08:55
have a guarantee whether you like it or not. It's just built into everything
1:09:00
that's sold in the country that you live in. So if you already have like a
1:09:05
guarantee, right? Then why not advertise it? Why not use it to your advantage to
1:09:11
reduce buyer friction and increase the selling power of all of your offers,
1:09:15
right? A power guarantee can triple sales, right? And they're called upon
1:09:21
less than 5% of the time. So, if you do the math, you tell me whether or not you
1:09:28
think it's going to be like worth it for your business, right? That's just like,
1:09:32
you know, you just got to just have a look at the numbers and see, do you
1:09:35
think it's going to be a calculated play to use this front and center of all your
1:09:39
marketing and potentially double, if not triple your sales and to only have 5% of
1:09:44
people ever call you up on it, right? And what we've found is from working
1:09:48
with thousands of clients in hundreds of different niches that this thing can
1:09:53
literally double your sales from just adding this element to your offer.
1:10:00
Right? So the seven steps to creating a power guarantee, right? Let's get busy
1:10:04
here. So is a step-by-step method for creating a power guarantee or pumping up
1:10:08
an existing one that you may have and really using it to supercharge your
1:10:13
marketing efforts. So the first one is studying the competition. And the reason
1:10:19
that this is important is obviously one to get ideas, but two to also see, you
1:10:24
know, how your guarantee is really going to basically stack up to what other
1:10:31
people are communicating in the marketplace. So the way that you do this
1:10:34
is just do a simple Google search um for other businesses in your industry and
1:10:39
just put the word guarantee in there. Um, and then take it one step further
1:10:43
and have someone call and ask about their guarantee or you call and ask
1:10:47
about their guarantee. And look, basically what you want to do is don't
1:10:52
just get tied into your industry. Look outside of your industry or outside of
1:10:56
your geography for solid guarantees and then write them down or copy and paste
1:11:01
them or put them in your swipe file. Do whatever you need to do. But go deep in
1:11:05
your search. Find out like what trends do you see? Do many companies in your
1:11:09
industry ever offer guarantees? What types of guarantees did you find? Did
1:11:14
you find any specific performance related guarantees or were they more
1:11:19
common like a like a lackluster satisfaction guarantee type and did they
1:11:23
dictate any of the terms of their guarantees? Have a look at those things,
1:11:26
colleate them, compare them. The second thing is to really laser in
1:11:32
on your strengths, right? So, what area of your business is like the really the
1:11:37
strongest point for you? Do you get results really quickly? Do you have
1:11:40
exceptional craftsmanship? Do you do very fast installations? Or are you a
1:11:46
great at maintenance? Or do your products or services produce
1:11:49
consistently outstanding results, right? Or do you save your your
1:11:55
customers like money or time, right? and whatever it is, you basically want to
1:12:02
really focus in on that, right? So, like always sell the thing that you do better
1:12:08
than your competition and craft the guarantee around that so you're not
1:12:12
going to have promise like problems delivering on that thing. Right? If you
1:12:16
provide outstanding results, then have a performance guarantee built in there,
1:12:22
right? Three is that you need to be specific.
1:12:25
Think about the specific results that your customer and your client wants or
1:12:30
the problem that they're trying to solve when they're buying your products or
1:12:33
services. Your guarantee should be specific, not some vague notion of like
1:12:38
satisfaction or your satisfaction guaranteed or any of that kind of crap.
1:12:42
Um, it's just far too broad, right? We need to make it specific and it needs to
1:12:46
be a specific promise. And then we need to tell, you know, your prospects that
1:12:51
they must experience the benefits that you're promising. otherwise that they
1:12:55
don't owe you a red scent, right? Or you give them all their money back, right?
1:13:00
What good things happen like you know when a client uses your product or
1:13:04
services, right? So you want to think about that like what are the good things
1:13:08
that happen? Do they have better sleep? Do they have more money? Do they lose
1:13:11
weight? Do they reduce their stress? Right? Write down whatever the answer is
1:13:15
in detail and then guarantee some component of that outcome or all of that
1:13:19
outcome. Right? Do not simply guarantee satisfaction. um you know guarantee what
1:13:25
it is in detail what the satisfaction will look like what your customer will
1:13:31
receive and then we want to make that measurable.
1:13:34
Four, choose a payback. As unlikely as it is that you'll be making good on your
1:13:39
guarantee because remember like I said less than fewer than 5% of customers
1:13:44
will ever take you up on it. But you want to make sure that you create an
1:13:50
attractive payback in case a customer is unsatisfied. And ideally, it won't cost
1:13:55
you much, but it will have like high perceived value and alleviate and remove
1:14:01
the perceived risk around the purchase. Your guarantee should exceed customer
1:14:06
expectations and be memorable, and it should wow them.
1:14:10
Five, test, measure, and refine. It's vitally important that you know how
1:14:16
well your guarantee is performing before you make it a core element to your
1:14:20
offer. So you don't just run out and start offering this thing like crazy.
1:14:24
You really need to figure out like how effective it is, right? And the way that
1:14:29
you do that is you can include it on like some of your landing pages and not
1:14:33
others. Or you can different like use different advertising channels for
1:14:38
instance have all the message on on Google for instance different to
1:14:41
Facebook or to YouTube or Instagram and then track the results test measure and
1:14:47
refine it until it is really like powerp packed and that you know that it's
1:14:52
pulling in sales and you want to pinpoint how much sales have grown over
1:14:56
the same period um last year or the period before that you had a guarantee
1:15:01
or split testing you know the certain like sell rate or conversion rate that
1:15:06
you're having, you know, since rolling it out. And you want to really be sure
1:15:09
to test um at least two combinations of your guarantee to find out the one that
1:15:16
pulls in the most sales. Six, put it front and center. Once you've tested and
1:15:21
you've measured and you've refined your guarantee and found a winner that's
1:15:25
really just pulling its head off, put your guarantee in writing and place it
1:15:30
front and center of all your marketing and your public relations and put it on
1:15:36
your website, on your landing pages, put it in your proposals, your ads, your
1:15:39
brochures, and anywhere that a customer will see it. Right? An example is like,
1:15:44
you know, how we use it on ours. Um, Google guaranteed Google rankings in 90
1:15:49
days or we work for free. Like that is such a compelling offer that it's
1:15:53
actually the the headline that we use on this landing page.
1:15:58
And lastly, number seven, give your guarantee a name. Like while this isn't
1:16:04
100% mandatory, giving your guarantee like a unique
1:16:09
name, it really dramatizes and it heightens the impact. And it's something
1:16:14
that you can have a lot of fun with. And I've included a list of really good
1:16:18
guarantee names in the resources section um for you to use, model, and get
1:16:22
inspiration from. Um, so the resources that you'll be using here is is the
1:16:27
market slaughtering power guarantees where I list out everything, all of the
1:16:31
seven points in there. We've got some great names for you to model for your
1:16:35
guarantee. You've also got your features and benefits and all that list that you
1:16:38
can fill out and document and do it. And that pretty much brings us to the end of
1:16:42
really the Godfather strategy and just forming something that is just going to
1:16:47
cut through your market like you know a like a hot knife to butter in terms of
1:16:52
getting the most cut through for your offers and ensuring that you are
1:16:56
converting as many prospects into highpaying customers a as possible.
1:17:02
Right? So the action items for this module is you need to create
1:17:07
your feature list. Write down every single feature that your your product or
1:17:11
service includes. Then write the corresponding benefit to those features.
1:17:16
And as I said, think of as many benefits for each feature as you can possibly
1:17:21
can. Exhaust this list as much as possible. Then reduce your offer to
1:17:27
writing and make it that one paragraph and really juice it up. Make it as
1:17:34
irresistible as possible. And once you've done that,
1:17:38
and only once you've done that, then you put the cherry on top by offering a
1:17:43
power guarantee that just removes all the risk associated with someone buying
1:17:49
off you and really just pumps that whole Godfather offer up on steroids and
1:17:55
really really makes it sings. So that's the end of this module. Go ahead, do
1:17:59
that stuff. Get to work and I will see you in the next one.
