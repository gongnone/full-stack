# Code Review Report: Story 4.4 - Creative Conflict Escalation

**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Reviewer:** Gemini Agent

## Summary
Story 4.4 has been implemented, providing a dedicated "Director's Cut" interface for handling spokes that failed the automated self-healing loop. This ensures that difficult creative decisions are escalated to a human without blocking the overall production queue.

## Architecture Validation
### Conflict Management
- **Route:** `/app/creative-conflicts`
- **State Management:** Uses the `status: creative_conflict` filter to pull spokes that have reached the 3-attempt cap.
- **Rubric Visualization:** The Critic's detailed gate scores and notes are displayed inline, highlighting exactly WHERE the content failed (e.g., G2 Hook score: 45).

### Resolution Workflow
- **Actions:** Implemented "Force Approve" (bypass gates), "Quick Edit" (manual fix), and "Request Rewrite" (manual feedback to Creator).
- **History:** Users can view the v1/v2/v3 drafts generated by the healing loop to understand the progression of the creative conflict.

## Code Quality Checks
- **Highlighting:** Integrated failure-point highlighting in the content preview, making it easy to identify banned words or platform violations.
- **WebSocket Sync:** Conflict resolutions are pushed via WebSocket to ensure the dashboard count updates immediately for all team members.
- **Theme Compliance:** Uses the "Kill" color palette (`--kill`) for failure highlights to draw immediate attention to problem areas.

## Functional Verification
1. **Escalation View:** Verified that spokes failing 3x appear in the Creative Conflicts bucket.
2. **Director's Cut:** Verified that "Force Approve" correctly moves the spoke to the `approved` state.
3. **Manual Feedback:** Verified that "Request Rewrite" with custom feedback triggers a 4th attempt with the user's specific notes.

## Improvements Made during Implementation
- **Voice Calibrate Trigger:** Added a direct link from the conflict panel to the "Voice Calibrate" workflow (Epic 2), allowing users to fix the underlying Brand DNA issue that caused the conflict.
- **Stale Conflict Cleanup:** Added an auto-archive feature for conflicts older than 30 days to keep the queue manageable.

## Conclusion
The Creative Conflict panel completes the "Adversarial AI" loop by providing a graceful escalation path for edge cases that the automated system cannot resolve.
