## Overview

BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) is a structured approach that replaces chaotic AI coding sessions with organized, role-based workflows. Rather than treating development as a single conversation thread, it "distributes responsibilities across specialized AI agents."

## The Six Phases

### Phase 1: Project Brainstorming (Analyst Agent)

This phase involves:
- Asking clarifying questions about goals, constraints, and success metrics
- Applying three brainstorming techniques
- Documenting key goals, constraints, risks, assumptions, and open questions

### Phase 2: Requirements Planning (Product Manager Agent)

Creates a Product Requirements Document including:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Epics
- Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- MVP scope definition
- Identification of knowledge gaps

### Phase 3: Technical Architecture (Architect Agent)

Designs the system architecture with:
- Tech stack justification
- Component diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Coding standards
- Data models
- Risk assessment

### Phase 4: Story Sequencing (Scrum Master Agent)

Breaks down epics into independent, testable developer stories with:
- Clear dependencies
- Tasks
- Prerequisites
- Acceptance criteria

### Phase 5: Implementation (Developer Agent)

Executes the actual coding:
- Following the architecture
- Maintaining coding standards
- Implementing incrementally
- Preparing work for review

### Phase 6: Quality Review (QA Agent)

Evaluates code against:
- Standards compliance
- Requirements coverage
- Test presence
- Code quality
- Security considerations
- Provides actionable feedback

## When to Use BMAD

**Use BMAD for:**
- Features requiring 8+ hours of development
- Multi-stakeholder projects
- Architecturally complex codebases
- Situations requiring generated documentation

**Skip BMAD for:**
- Quick fixes
- Exploratory prototyping
- Solo projects
- Straightforward feature additions to established patterns
