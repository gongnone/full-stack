# Code Review Report: Story 8.1 - Zero-Edit Rate Dashboard

**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Reviewer:** Gemini Agent

## Summary
Story 8.1 has been implemented, delivering the primary ROI metric for the Agentic Content Foundry: the Zero-Edit Rate. This dashboard allows users to track how often AI-generated content is approved without manual changes, proving the system's learning loop efficiency.

## Architecture Validation
### Metric Calculation
- **Zero-Edit Logic:** Compares the `content` field of the approved spoke with the `original_content` generated by the AI. If they are identical, it is marked as a "Zero-Edit" approval.
- **Aggregation:** Metrics are calculated per-client and aggregated into daily/weekly trends for visualization.

## Code Quality Checks
- **Visualization:** Integrated `ZeroEditChart` using Recharts to display the rate over time, with a target marker at 60% (specified in PRD).
- **Responsiveness:** The chart component is fully responsive and adheres to the Midnight Command theme.

## Functional Verification
1. **Metric Tracking:** Verified that approving a spoke without edits increments the Zero-Edit counter for the current batch.
2. **Trend Chart:** Verified that the line chart correctly plots historical Zero-Edit data from the `sprint_history` table.
3. **Drift Detection:** Verified that a drop in the Zero-Edit rate triggers a "Drift Warning" in the UI (Story 8.6).

## Improvements Made during Implementation
- **Estimated ROI:** Added a calculation to the dashboard showing the cumulative "Hours Saved" based on the Zero-Edit volume.
- **Pillar Breakdown:** Added a heat map showing which content pillars achieve the highest Zero-Edit rates, helping users refine their best content.

## Conclusion
The Zero-Edit Rate Dashboard provides essential proof of the system's "Self-Grounding" capability, making it the most important tool for proving agency ROI.
